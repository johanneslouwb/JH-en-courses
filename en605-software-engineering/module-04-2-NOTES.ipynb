    "# Importance of Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key reasons why requirements are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, the requirements phase in a project can be a **major source of defects** that get introduced into the project.\n",
    "- Second, the requirements are used as **input to many of the subsequent project work phases**.\n",
    "- Third, **requirements errors can be costly and time consuming to fix** and contribute significantly to a project’s rework costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "### A significant source of project Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements phase can be a significant source of project errors. More than **half of all errors** introduced\n",
    "during the course of a project can be introduced in the requirements phase. If an organization can improve the requirements process so that these error levels are reduced, there are many cost and schedule benefits to be had.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input to subsequent project work:\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements can be used as input to many of the subsequent project work phases. For example, requirements are used as a direct input to the design process and the test planning process. If the requirements are defective it can have a negative impact on the design and test efforts as well. And, there can be many other processes that use the requirements as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costly and Time consuming to fix:\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements errors can be costly and time-consuming to fix:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/02.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some industry studies have measured the percentage of **rework effort** on projects to range from **40 percent to more than 50** percent of total project effort. This indicates that for every 1,000 total person- hours of effort, about 450 person-hours was spent on rework. \n",
    "\n",
    "About 80 percent of rework effort is spent **fixing problems that occurred as a result of bad requirements**. If we apply this to the first rework statistics; then 80% of 45% is 36%; so, 36% of rework effort on a typical project is spent reworking bad requirements - a very significant contribution to project cost and project schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Requirements Defects:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/03.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "80 percent of the requirements defects fall into two categories; \n",
    "- incorrect requirements information and,\n",
    "- omitted requirements information.\n",
    "\n",
    "So; if we want to reduce the number of requirements defects; one strategy to take is to look at **the drivers that cause these two types of errors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, what makes a GOOD requirement?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/04.png\" width=250>\n",
    "\n",
    "Good requirements are: \n",
    "- correct, \n",
    "- complete, \n",
    "- testable, and \n",
    "- unambiguous. I\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that correctness and completeness is at the top of the list. That’s because 80 percent of requirements problems fall into these two categories as we saw in an earlier slide. Note also that these characteristics are also correlated with each other to a certain extent. For example, an incomplete requirement is also incorrect. A requirement that is untestable may be that way because the requirement is ambiguous, or because the requirement is incomplete, and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "A requirement should contain correct information; so why is incorrectness at the top of the major defects list? Let’s look at what may cause a requirement to be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that can drive correctness is the identification collaboration effort with key project stakeholders If the key project stakeholders are not identified, or if they are not collaborated with; then we risk getting incorrect information. **Solution**; make sure that our work process includes a stakeholder identification step that identifies all project stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completeness:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of completeness; \n",
    "\n",
    "- **micro-level completeness**: Micro-level completeness is applied to each individual requirement. Is that requirement completely defined? That’s not usually a problem for non-functional requirements, but it’s a bigger problem for functional requirements. So; how can this be **mitigated**? Remember the five-part functional requirements model we looked at earlier. Each functional requirement must have a definition, and may have inputs, outputs, business rules, and constraints \n",
    "\n",
    "- **macro-level completeness**: Is applied to the entire set of requirements for a project. At that level, the requirements are complete if all the needed requirements for the project have been identified; and that’s often hard to assess. So, how can we **mitigate this problem**? To help ensure that all the non-functional requirements have been identified we can use a checklist of possible non-functional requirements; and simply go through each potential non-functional requirement and determine if it is applicable to our project. Incomplete non-functional requirements are often the result of oversight; so a checklist is a simple tool to deal with this. For assessing the completeness of functional requirements at the macro level, there are **two key things that can help**: one: using an iterative life cycle, and two: using use cases to capture the project’s functional requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testable and Unambiguous:\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at these together since they are highly correlated. A good requirement is unambiguous, meaning it has only one interpretation. A requirement that has multiple interpretations can cause incorrectness as a project progresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a software engineer may interpret a requirement in a particular way and base their design and coding assumptions on that interpretation. But, the engineer’s interpretation may not match with the business stakeholder interpretation, and it’s that interpretation that sets expectations. Ambiguity **can be mitigated** by choosing an effective documentation technique and by applying the testability test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A requirement is testable if we can answer “yes” to the following questions: \n",
    "- can we construct a set of tests to demonstrate whether this requirement has been implemented (or not) in the software product? \n",
    "- whether it has been implemented correctly and completely. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer to either question is “no”, then the requirement is not testable; and; it may be because it is ambiguous. Let me take an example. Suppose a requirement stated that “all aspects of product performance shall be optimized.” That fails the testability test; because it is ambiguous. You can also see how design and coding decisions made by a software engineer’s interpretation of that requirement can lead to incorrectness.\n",

    "# Activities and Work Products\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the key activities in the requirements definition process. This input/output model shows the basic inputs, tasks, and work products associated with a requirements definition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/05.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in this process that analysts will:\n",
    "- identify key stakeholder groups, \n",
    "- evaluate the system boundary, and \n",
    "- elicit stakeholder needs to identify the project’s functional and non-functional requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements may also be prioritized and validated as part of this work, and may be packaged into delivery cycles if an iterative or incremental project life cycle model is being followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major deliverable work products produced in this activity** typically include a \n",
    "- Vision Document, \n",
    "- a use case model; if the project is using a use-case driven approach; \n",
    "- or a functional requirements specification document if use cases are not being used, \n",
    "- and a supplementary specification document\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the organization, there may be additional work products produced, and the information that is contained in what we are calling a Vision Document and a Supplementary Spec may be packaged into documents with different names; but we're going to use these two documents because they are a very effective way to capture and organize essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s worth noting here that if our project is using an object-oriented approach this model would represent the first step in object-oriented requirements analysis; and the work products listed here would represent the user view of requirements. These documents would make no mention of objects, but would serve as the input to the object-oriented requirements analysis step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vision Document:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample Vision Document** template is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/06.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vision Document specifies the stakeholders’ view of the product to be developed. It is written in terms of the stakeholders’ key goals/needs and desired features. And, it provides the basis for eliciting and specifying the more detailed product requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the document’s components, like business opportunity and problem statement, are pretty obvious in their meanings. Some of the components, like market demographics, may not be applicable to every organization and project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Section 3 in this document is extremely important. It contains a description of product stakeholders and their needs. Note that there are two types of stakeholders: end user stakeholders and non-user stakeholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "A relatively common industry problem is failure to actually collaborate with end users during the requirements phase; and it almost always results in products that are lacking needed functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The many types of Stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about project stakeholders and how they contribute to more correct and complete requirements. We also defined a stakeholder as any entity that was directly or indirectly impacted by the project at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this definition of the term stakeholder is extremely useful in helping a project team identify a more complete set of candidate stakeholders. There can be many types or categories of stakeholder for a project; and this diagram illustrates a sampling of that.This is a layered or concentric ring model; and it can help in identifying a more complete set of stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/07.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the center is the system we’re gathering requirements for. The first layer of stakeholders is what we call direct stakeholders. These stakeholders are directly impacted by the product we are building, and they consist of, for example, end users, project sponsors, developers, testers, those that will have to support the system when it’s in production, and so forth. You can add more categories depending upon the specific organization and product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer is the enterprise layer. This layer consists of stakeholders that may be indirectly impacted by the system. And the third layer consists of entities outside the organization. This might include service providers and regulators, as examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case Document:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many projects today are use-case-driven. I.E., use cases are used to document the project’s\n",
    "functional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A use case is a different way of documenting functional requirements. It documents those requirements by essentially telling a story that contains related functions the system must perform, the order in which they are performed, and the user interactions that are involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/08.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a partial use case that describes some of the steps and interactions required to process a sale transaction in a point-of-sale system. If you read through the ten steps note that it kind of tells a story about what functions the system must perform when processing a sale. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Supplementary Spec:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important document that is produced during the requirements elicitation activity is a Supplementary\n",
    "Specification document. Below is a template:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/09.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Section one of this supplementary spec is essentially the same as the first section of the Vision Document. In cases where it is the same, common practice is just to point to that section in the Vision Document instead of regurgitating all the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section two of the Supplementary Spec contains a section for documenting functional requirements that are documented in the traditional way. (“traditional way” meaning not using use cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Section three of the spec contains a section for documenting business rules. The business rules could be global business rules, business rules referenced in use cases, or business rules referenced in section two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining sections of the spec are used to document a project’s non-functional requirements. Not all of these sections would be applicable for all projects, but they represent a pretty good list of possible non- functional requirements.\n",

    "# Use Cases vs. Traditional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "So what really is a Use-case? Simply put:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A use case is a way of documenting the functional requirements for a software product. A use case describes a set of interactions between the product we are gathering requirements for, users of that product, and other systems the product will interact with. Use cases are used to describe the *functional* requirements for a software product.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/10.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the sample above - let’s suppose we are gathering requirements for a point of sale software product that will be used by retail stores. One of the things such a system must be able to do is to support the processing of a sale transaction; and a use case like the one shown here might be written to describe the interactions and system functions associated with a sale transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of this use case is Process Sale. If you read through the ten steps, you can see that they describe what’s involved in processing a sale transaction. Now, this use case is only a partial use case. It’s incomplete in a number of ways. For example, the last step involves printing a receipt; but the data elements that must appear on the receipt are not specified yet. Also, the use case doesn’t describe the different interactions required if a customer pays by cash, credit card, or check. And it doesn’t specify what happens if a customer chooses to pay by credit card, but the charge can’t be authorized. It needs to deal with all of these things, and more, before it’s complete. But; it will suffice for our purposes right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE that a use case tells kind of a story about what needs to be done to process a sale. This “story” nature of use cases is very powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-column format use case:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/11.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‘s exactly the same process sale use case, but presented in a different format. We call this the two-\n",
    "column format. Things called actor actions are shown in the left-hand column, and system functions are shown in the right hand column. We will cover actor shortly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the **single-column format** shown at the beginning of the lecture is the **most frequently used format**. There‘s really no difference except for the visual appearance; the same information is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use-cases vs. Traditional:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases are a different way of documenting requirements compared to the traditional way of\n",
    "documenting requirements. (traditional way meaning without using use cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod042/12.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is skeleton of pieces of a traditional requirements document. One way such a document might be organized is to have a section for system inputs, a section for system outputs, one for calculations, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now; let‘s assume for our sample point of sale product, that the requirements document is 70 pages in length -  and; let‘s assume that the requirement that the system calculate total sale amount is on page 17 of that document, and the requirement for printing the receipt is on page 55 of that document. As a reader of that document, if I‘m interested in learning about all the functions required to process a sale transaction, I need to parse through the document and try to pick out all the related functional requirements; one is on page 17, one is on page 55, and the others will be scattered throughout the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "This presents quite a challenge. If I‘m a developer, or a tester, it‘s really important that I be able to find all the related functionality. If some required functionality was inadvertently left out of the document or not identified during the requirements process; it may be very hard to tell\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let‘s compare this to the use case approach. Take a look at every step in the use case that uses the word system. Each step that contains the word system represents at least one primitive level functional requirements. The system has to prompt the cashier, display running totals, calculate total sale amount, display a payment entry form, save the sale information and print a receipt. That‘s at least a half dozen primitive level functions; but they‘re all related to processing a sale transaction...and they‘re all documented right here in that single use case instead of being scattered throughout 70 pages of documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has many advantages. If there‘s a missing function it will be a lot easier to identify it. Also, the story nature of the use case presents readers of the use case with a vision of the future product. If I‘m a tester, the use case will form the basis of my test scenarios and identify all the functions that need to be exercised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we saw that 80 percent of requirements defects are due to incomplete or incorrect requirements. We also learned about macro level requirements completeness; did we identify and document all the needed functionality. Use cases significantly help to ensure macro level completeness compared to the traditional approach\n",
