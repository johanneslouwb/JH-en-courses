    "\n",
    "In Activity based estimation, we'll now focus on **task sequencing** (TS). TS must be done before project schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In task sequencing, we identify the dependencies between project tasks. Some tasks may be done in parallel (no dependency between tasks) and other tasks need to be done in order (dependencies between tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an input/output model for the task sequencing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary inputs are a list of the defined tasks, and any assumptions and constraints. Assumptions might be some of the same assumptions that went into the task definition process. An example of constraints might be that certain tasks have mandatory due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools and techniques involved in the task sequencing process are primarily the identification of task dependencies and the construction of what is called a project network diagram. Task identification and construction of a project network diagram are very mportant because they help form the foundation for estimating a project’s schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks have different dependencies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks will have what’s called **mandatory dependencies** (dependencies that are inherent in the nature of the work that needs to be performed). For example, design before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks may have **discretionary dependencies** (defined by the project manager or whoever is responsible for planning the project parts). For example, manager, may decide to break programming task into sub-tasks and have each subtask assigned to separate programmers so that they can be worked on in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of dependency is an **external dependency** (arise due to activities that have to be completed, but are outside of the direct sphere of influence of the project manager). For example, pieces of a project may be contracted out to external suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrating dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Project network diagramming involves building a graphical model of the task dependencies. Many project management tools have features that enable building this diagram, and there are different notational formats that might be used. One type of project network diagram is called a **PERT chart**. A **Gantt chart** is another common tool for illustrating task dependencies…but the dependencies can be harder to see, depending upon how the Gantt chart is constructed and how much detail is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs to the task sequencing process include the project network diagram and possibly an updated task list. As an example, a previously defined task may have been divided into sub-tasks during the task sequencing process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Schedule estimation involves taking the task dependencies, effort estimates, project constraints, and resource assignments and estimating the calendar completion dates for key project tasks and the overall project completion date.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are different things that influence a project's schedule (whether it be making it shorter or longer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effort**: More effort, often but not always translates into a longer schedule.\n",
    "- **Task dependencies** influence project schedule in a very significant way.\n",
    "- **Resources available**: Limited resources means not being able to break tasks into smaller ones to be worked in parallel - meaning staff will need more time\n",
    "- **Project deadlines**: When we have project deadlines that can’t be changed, we often need to work backwards from those deadlines when calculating the schedule, and sometimes find that deadlines can’t be met for a given scope of work or a fixed pool of available resources.\n",
    "- **Interruptions**: people get interrupted and also sometimes multi-task. When you multi-task, there is a 'ramp-up' time associated that you need to re-orient yourself each time. \n",

    "- a list of available resources namely people or job categories that will be assigned to the project. Important to note that one person might not be as productive as another (not all are equal).\n",
    "- a set of assumptions and constraints. Having a clear understanding of any assumptions that are being made and documenting those assumptions is crucial to arriving at a realistic schedule estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the **output** side is \n",

    "\n",
    "The critical path is the sum of the longest path - and this is the time we use for project completion time. In our above example, the project completion time is **7 days**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taks ON the critical path cannot have any **slippage** (said to have **0-slack or float**). Meaning, if a task ON the critical path takes longer, the whole project takes longer. However, a task that is NOT on the critical path taking longer doesn't mean that the whole project will take longer (to a degree) - these are said to have slack or float. \n",

    "## Incorporating Uncertainty into Project Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which we can incorporate uncertainty into our project estimation:\n",
    "1) Present a **range** of values for estimates\n",
    "2) Quote **probabilities** associated with estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how we get **range** values for estimates: **the three-point estimating techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/14.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-point estimating technique can be used to make any estimate (cost, effort size, schedule etc) - and it involves doing 3 estimates - the best case, most likely and worst case. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use this to do an estimate of person hours required to do something. We think under the best conditions the task could be completed in 2 person hours, and it is virtually impossible to be completed with any less effort. So, this is our optimistic effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the worst case conditions the task might require 8 person-hours. Realistically, we don’t think it could take longer than that. So, eight person-hours is our pessimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our most likely estimate should be somewhere between the two extremes. This is the one that would have the highest probability of occurring. So, in this case, 5 person-hours is the most likely estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our optimistic and pessimistic estimates are **realistic**, then the probability that we complete the task in 2-8 person hours should be 100 percent. If they are not realistic (it could take less than 2 person hours or more than 8 person hours) then the probability will be less than 100 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the worst and best case scenarios were **equidistant** - which means it will be **bell shaped** - however, it need not be like this - it could be **skewed** too. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Which do we use**? Many will use the most likely. Management and stakeholders will likely choose the optimistic if they have the choice. And no one will likely believe the pessimistic unless we have clearly documented the assumptions behind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One approach is to give all three estimates along with the associated assumptions. \n",
    "- Another approach is to quote the pessimistic minus the optimistic. \n",
    "- And a third approach is to quote a single estimate that we feel comfortable with!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring Probability more:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under the curve of the probability distribution around our estimates should be very near 100 percent. Since it is symmetric, 50% of the are is to the left, and 50% is to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we have a 50 percent chance of the task taking less than 5 person-hours and a 50 percent chance of it taking more than 5 hours. So if we quote the most likely estimate, there is a 50 percent chance that the actual effort will fall within 2-5 person-hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the illustration that the probability of completing the task within 6 person-hours is more than 50 percent so we may be more comfortable quoting that as a point estimate. It’s not obvious from the illustration what probability is associated with 6 person-hours, but it can, in fact, be calculated, if we apply the three-point technique with a bit more rigor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last example, our most likely estimate was **equidistant** from the optimistic and pessimistic estimates. This resulted in a **symmetric probability** distribution around the most likely estimate. In practice, the probability distribution can be **skewed** as illustrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/17.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the optimistic and most likely estimates are close to one another, the probability distribution would look like the one in the middle. It would correspond to greater uncertainty around the pessimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pessimistic and most likely estimates are close to one another, the probability distribution would look like the one at the bottom. It would correspond to greater uncertainty around the optimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the 3-point technique for a single work task - and in reality, you would do the computation for all tasks associated with a project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if expert judgment or a technique like the Delphi method is used in our estimating process, the **three-point technique could be used there as well to express uncertainty** (IN ADDITION TO)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The three point technique is particularly useful when we have little historical data or for project types that have never been done before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll look at how to compute the probabilities\n",
