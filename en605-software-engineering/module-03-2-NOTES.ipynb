    "\n",
    "In Activity based estimation, we'll now focus on **task sequencing** (TS). TS must be done before project schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In task sequencing, we identify the dependencies between project tasks. Some tasks may be done in parallel (no dependency between tasks) and other tasks need to be done in order (dependencies between tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an input/output model for the task sequencing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary inputs are a list of the defined tasks, and any assumptions and constraints. Assumptions might be some of the same assumptions that went into the task definition process. An example of constraints might be that certain tasks have mandatory due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools and techniques involved in the task sequencing process are primarily the identification of task dependencies and the construction of what is called a project network diagram. Task identification and construction of a project network diagram are very mportant because they help form the foundation for estimating a project’s schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks have different dependencies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks will have what’s called **mandatory dependencies** (dependencies that are inherent in the nature of the work that needs to be performed). For example, design before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks may have **discretionary dependencies** (defined by the project manager or whoever is responsible for planning the project parts). For example, manager, may decide to break programming task into sub-tasks and have each subtask assigned to separate programmers so that they can be worked on in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of dependency is an **external dependency** (arise due to activities that have to be completed, but are outside of the direct sphere of influence of the project manager). For example, pieces of a project may be contracted out to external suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrating dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Project network diagramming involves building a graphical model of the task dependencies. Many project management tools have features that enable building this diagram, and there are different notational formats that might be used. One type of project network diagram is called a **PERT chart**. A **Gantt chart** is another common tool for illustrating task dependencies…but the dependencies can be harder to see, depending upon how the Gantt chart is constructed and how much detail is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs to the task sequencing process include the project network diagram and possibly an updated task list. As an example, a previously defined task may have been divided into sub-tasks during the task sequencing process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Schedule estimation involves taking the task dependencies, effort estimates, project constraints, and resource assignments and estimating the calendar completion dates for key project tasks and the overall project completion date.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different things that influence a project's schedule (whether it be making it shorter or longer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effort**: More effort, often but not always translates into a longer schedule.\n",
    "- **Task dependencies** influence project schedule in a very significant way.\n",
    "- **Resources available**: Limited resources means not being able to break tasks into smaller ones to be worked in parallel - meaning staff will need more time\n",
    "- **Project deadlines**: When we have project deadlines that can’t be changed, we often need to work backwards from those deadlines when calculating the schedule, and sometimes find that deadlines can’t be met for a given scope of work or a fixed pool of available resources.\n",
    "- **Interruptions**: people get interrupted and also sometimes multi-task. When you multi-task, there is a 'ramp-up' time associated that you need to re-orient yourself each time. \n",

    "\n",
    "The critical path is the sum of the longest path - and this is the time we use for project completion time. In our above example, the project completion time is **7 days**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taks ON the critical path cannot have any **slippage** (said to have **0-slack or float**). Meaning, if a task ON the critical path takes longer, the whole project takes longer.

    "## Incorporating Uncertainty into Project Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways in which we can incorporate uncertainty into our project estimation:\n",
    "1) Present a **range** of values for estimates\n",
    "2) Quote **probabilities** associated with estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how we get **range** values for estimates: **the three-point estimating techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/14.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-point estimating technique can be used to make any estimate (cost, effort size, schedule etc) - and it involves doing 3 estimates - the best case, most likely and worst case. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use this to do an estimate of person hours required to do something. We think under the best conditions the task could be completed in 2 person hours, and it is virtually impossible to be completed with any less effort. So, this is our optimistic effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the worst case conditions the task might require 8 person-hours. Realistically, we don’t think it could take longer than that. So, eight person-hours is our pessimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our most likely estimate should be somewhere between the two extremes. This is the one that would have the highest probability of occurring. So, in this case, 5 person-hours is the most likely estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our optimistic and pessimistic estimates are **realistic**, then the probability that we complete the task in 2-8 person hours should be 100 percent. If they are not realistic (it could take less than 2 person hours or more than 8 person hours) then the probability will be less than 100 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the worst and best case scenarios were **equidistant** - which means it will be **bell shaped** - however, it need not be like this - it could be **skewed** too. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Which do we use**? Many will use the most likely. Management and stakeholders will likely choose the optimistic if they have the choice. And no one will likely believe the pessimistic unless we have clearly documented the assumptions behind it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- One approach is to give all three estimates along with the associated assumptions. \n",
    "- Another approach is to quote the pessimistic minus the optimistic. \n",
    "- And a third approach is to quote a single estimate that we feel comfortable with!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring Probability more:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The area under the curve of the probability distribution around our estimates should be very near 100 percent. Since it is symmetric, 50% of the are is to the left, and 50% is to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we have a 50 percent chance of the task taking less than 5 person-hours and a 50 percent chance of it taking more than 5 hours. So if we quote the most likely estimate, there is a 50 percent chance that the actual effort will fall within 2-5 person-hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the illustration that the probability of completing the task within 6 person-hours is more than 50 percent so we may be more comfortable quoting that as a point estimate. It’s not obvious from the illustration what probability is associated with 6 person-hours, but it can, in fact, be calculated, if we apply the three-point technique with a bit more rigor. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last example, our most likely estimate was **equidistant** from the optimistic and pessimistic estimates. This resulted in a **symmetric probability** distribution around the most likely estimate. In practice, the probability distribution can be **skewed** as illustrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/17.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the optimistic and most likely estimates are close to one another, the probability distribution would look like the one in the middle. It would correspond to greater uncertainty around the pessimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the pessimistic and most likely estimates are close to one another, the probability distribution would look like the one at the bottom. It would correspond to greater uncertainty around the optimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the 3-point technique for a single work task - and in reality, you would do the computation for all tasks associated with a project. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if expert judgment or a technique like the Delphi method is used in our estimating process, the **three-point technique could be used there as well to express uncertainty** (IN ADDITION TO)\n",
    "\n",
    "> The three point technique is particularly useful when we have little historical data or for project types that have never been done before.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/18.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep using the seminar marketing example. As you can see, we've started with the **3-point estimates** - the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic\n",

    "### Revisiting PERT:\n",
    "\n",
    "PERT is an estimating scheduling technique developed for **projects never done before** and which **has numerous schedule risks**. It is often used in projects for which **schedule is more important than cost.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that PERT can help to answer:\n",
    "- What is the earliest project completion time?\n",
    "- What is the most likely project completion time?\n",
    "- What is the probability that the project will be a month late?\n",
    "- What is the probability that the project will be finished in 6-8 months? \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that **probability** is a key repeating word here. With PERT, you can actually compute these probabilities. In its basic form, PERT can be used to incorporate risk into effort and schedule estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use PERT, we factor probabilities into the estimates of ‘o’ and ‘p’ by choosing a **confidence level** (c). We choose an optimistic estimate so that we feel there is only a ‘c percent’ chance that the actual effort will be less than our optimistic value…and we choose a pessimistic estimate so that we feel there is only a ‘c percent’ chance that the actual effort will be greater than it. Common values for the confidence level are 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent. This is really a guess on our part, but it allows us to make some statistical calculations and statements. And in practice, we would document any assumptions behind our choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/20.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "In PERT, we then estimate the project schedule by using a weighted average for each task estimate. The formula for the weighted average is to sum the optimistic estimate, the pessimistic estimate, and 4 times the most likely estimate…and divide by 6…to get the estimate of expected effort. It might not seem intuitive, but it is based on the average for a type of statistical distribution called a beta distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected effort estimates are then used to calculate the project schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common measure used in statistics is the variance associated with an estimate. The variance measures the dispersion around an estimate and in the PERT technique it reflects the amount of uncertainty around an estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/21.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we made three estimates for a task in which the most likely estimate is 10, the optimistic is 9 and the pessimistic is 11. If we plotted the probability that the actual value would fall between the optimistic and pessimistic, the curve might look something like the one illustrated in blue. If the optimistic was 6 and the pessimistic was 14, the probability distribution would look like the one illustrated in red. Simplistically, the width of the red curve is greater than the width of the blue curve and it’s a visual illustration of variance. It has a larger variance than the blue curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example there are bell-shaped curves around an estimate, because the optimistic and pessimistic estimates are equidistant from the most likely. The earlier showed examples where the probability distributions were skewed towards either the optimistic or pessimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use PERT, the variance of an estimate is calculated according to the  formula the square of the pessimistic minus optimistic divided by six. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, or pessimistic minus optimistic divided by 6. Both of these measures are used when we calculate probabilities. Like the weighted average formula, these formulas are not intuitive. They are also associated with a beta distribution but that’s not really important in order to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the email campaign project, the weighted task averages are shown in this table. As it turns out, the estimated project duration is the same as in the earlier example, where the three-point estimates were not used. In practice, it could very well be different when the weighted values are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/22.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "I also calculated the variance of each task estimate, as well as the variance of the critical path estimate. The variance of the critical path estimate is the sum of the variances of the critical path tasks. In this case, the value is 4/9. The variance and the weighted average will be used in calculating probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "So…how do we actually calculate probabilities? It’s really pretty mechanical…but first…a little more statistics!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/23.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the formula for the weighted average task durations…it is assumed that the project duration is distributed statistically according to a Normal distribution. A normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve. The mean, or average, of that distribution is the critical path duration, which we’ll call A in this illustration, and the standard deviation of the distribution is the standard deviation of the critical path tasks…calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the critical path task variances…which we’ll call $S^2$. The use of a Normal distribution has been shown to be a reasonable approximation of the Beta distribution in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Normal distribution, we can calculate probabilities from a table of pre-calculated values by using something called a standard normal deviate and the formula illustrated here. Let’s assume we want to calculate the probability that the project will be completed within D days. Z is the standard normal deviate, A is the estimated schedule value, and S2 is the sum of the critical path task variances. We calculate the value of Z and then look up the probability value from a probability table. That’s all there is to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Take an Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/24.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our email campaign project, the expected completion time, A, is seven and two-third days. What’s the probability that the project will be completed within seven and two-third days? Well…since we’re using a Normal distribution with mean value of seven and two-thirds, we can see the answer just by looking at the illustration. The area under the entire curve is equal to one…or 100 percent…by definition. Since the mean…seven and two-thirds…is the halfway point, the area to the left of the mean is the probability that the project completes within seven and two-third days. Since the distribution is symmetric, half the area is to the left, so the probability of completing within 7 and two-third days is 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the standard normal deviate calculation and look up the probability.  The value of the standard deviate is zero, so we look up the area corresponding to a standard deviate value of zero in a probability table…highlighted in yellow…and see that the result is 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the standard normal deviate calculation and look up the probability.  The value of the standard deviate is zero, so we look up the area corresponding to a standard deviate value of zero in a probability table…highlighted in yellow…and see that the result is 50 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/25.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take another example. What’s the probability of completing the project within 6 days? In this case, the value of the standard normal deviate is -2.5, so we look up the probability associated with -2.5…which is .0062… a little less than one percent. For your reference, a copy of the probability tables is included on the course website as part of the materials for this unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for standard deviation that was used in my examples assume that the confidence level of our pessimistic and optimistic estimates were one percent. That is, there was a one percent chance that the actual optimistic duration could be less than the optimistic estimate and a one percent chance that the actual on the pessimistic side could exceed our pessimistic estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/26.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other values for confidence level that are often used in practice are 5 percent and 10 percent. To use these confidence levels with our Normal probability distribution we need to adjust the standard deviation formulas as indicated here. Note that these formulas result in larger values of standard deviation than the one I used, because there is more margin of error in or estimates…but these estimates may be more realistic and easier to come up with than for a one percent confidence level.\n",

    "If the actual data shows that the project is progressing according to plan, nothing needs to be done by management except perhaps to report the results to stakeholders. If things aren’t progressing according to plan, then management needs to take some corrective action. \n",

For example, if 50 percent of the planned effort for a task has been incurred at the end of a reporting period, it is not uncommon to report that the task is half finished. In reality, this may be misleading, because it’s just a measure of charged time to planned time. The reality might be that the task effort was underestimated and it might actually take 150 percent of the planned effort to complete the task. \n",

    "The first table illustrates part of our project plan. It contains the planned duration of three project tasks, their budgeted costs, and the budgeted costs per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second table contains actual project data four weeks into the project. The budgeted cost of work scheduled is computed from the project plan data and appears in the first column of the table. For example, task one is scheduled at a cost of \\\\$300 per week, so its budgeted value after four weeks is \\\\$1200. Similar computations are made for tasks two and three.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second column in the table contains the actual costs incurred during the four week period. Let’s assume that task one was completed by the end of week four it was completed ahead of schedule. At \\\\$300 per week, the actual cost of work performed is \\\\$1,200. The earned value, however, is the full amount of the planned cost for this task \\\\$1,500. Task two was completed on schedule, at the end of week three, so its earned value at the end of week 4 is the original budgeted cost of \\\\$3,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task three had 7 deliverables associated with it. Only 2 of those deliverables were actually produced by the end of week four, but a cost of \\\\$2,900 was incurred through the end of week four, so the actual cost of work performed is \\\\$2,900. Since only 2 milestones were delivered, the earned value for task 3 is 2/7 of the budgeted cost of \\\\$5,700 or \\\\$1,628.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does this tell us? It tells us that task 1 was completed ahead of schedule, task 2 was completed on schedule, and task 3 is running behind schedule and will likely result in a cost overrun as well.\n",

    "#### Cost and Schedule Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost and schedule variance are absolute measures that indicate the deviations between planned performance and actual progress, in monetary units.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/32.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost variance** is the difference between the budgeted cost of work performed (the earned value) and the actual cost of work performed. A positive cost variance indicates that a task or project is ahead of plan. A zero cost variance indicates things are on plan, and a negative cost variance indicates things are over budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule variance is the difference between the budgeted cost of work performed (earned value) and the budgeted cost of work scheduled. A positive schedule variance indicates that things are ahead of schedule, a zero value indicates on schedule, and a negative value indicates things are behind schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost and Schedule Variance example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/33.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the project data we looked at earlier, this table shows the computation of cost and schedule variance four weeks into the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looked at task by task, we can see that task one is finished ahead of schedule, task two was right on schedule, and task three is behind schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variances can be summed to get variance measures for the entire project. The project is behind schedule and over budget, earned-value-wise. Now in terms of schedule, does this mean that the project will actually finish behind schedule? It depends. If task three is on the critical path then yes. If it is not on the critical path then it will depend on whether it falls behind schedule enough to change the project’s critical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plotting Cost and Schedule Indices:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/34.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional measures that are sometimes used in tracking project progress include plotting the cost performance index and schedule performance index values over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost performance index is the ratio of earned value to the actual cost of work performed. The schedule performance index is the ratio of the earned value to the budgeted cost of work scheduled. This chart shows the two indices plotted over the first four weeks of our sample project…using values for the entire project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance index values greater than one indicate that things are ahead of plan, a value of one indicates things are going according to plan, and a value less than one indicates over budget or behind schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture I provided a quick summary of project tracking and control, and a simple overview of the earned value technique. There can be many more moving parts associated with earned value tracking. In the federal contracting arena, for example, government agencies often require that extensive earned value tracking and reporting be implemented on many projects. "
