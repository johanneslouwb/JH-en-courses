    "# 7F: Behaviour Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We saved the most powerful notation for last. Behavior modeling. When most people think about analysis or design, they generally think about modeling the behavior of the system. We just want to make sure you also model the structure and information as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore some techniques for modeling the behavior of the system. There are two types of behavior models: \n",
    "- Imperative and \n",
    "- Declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imperative \n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative models describe how things happen. We describe change over time. Usually this change is the change in state of the system, but it also may include input and output events.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at three examples of imperative models. There are certainly more than these three, but these are the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Case Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen use case specifications when we did our requirements modeling. The flow of events is an imperative model describing a sequence of events. These events can be inputs from the actors to the system, outputs from the system to actors, or things that happen inside the system. We also describe alternate flows to take care of all of the variations in behavior of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notation could also be used to describe what happens inside the system during analysis or design, but typically it is reserved only for requirements specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/01.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "An activity diagram is a Unified Modeling Language diagram that looks like a traditional flowchart. The rectangular boxes with the rounded corners are called actions. Think of an action as some behavior that is performed by a component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components that perform the actions are frequently shown at the tops of partitions, or so- called “swim lanes.” Here we see three things that can perform behaviors: Chef, Oven and Guests. This is the activity diagram for baking a cake. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actions are connected by arrows that indicate the order in which the actions are performed. The actions are shown in the swim lane of the component that performs them. Diamonds indicate that the flow may take different paths depending on the value of the conditions that annotate the flows. These conditions are called guards. So we will bake the cake at different temperatures and for different times depending on the altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bold bars indicate asynchronous activities. In this model, the activities of mixing the dry ingredients and mixing the wet ingredients may be done in either order, or, in fact, at the same time if there is more than one chef or the chef is ambidextrous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/02.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence diagram is one of the more **powerful notations for illustrating dynamic behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxes at the top are the components that perform the activities. The lines below the components represent that component over time. An arrow between two timelines represents s a message from one component to another. We can show returns as dashed lines. The order of the arrows, top to bottom, indicates the sequence in which the messages are sent or returns occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more to sequence diagram notation. We will see a lot of it when we get into object oriented analysis and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "Declarative models don’t describe how things happen, but they only specify rules for what will happen in various circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are already familiar with decision tables and state transition diagrams from our discussion of requirements modeling. These models can also be used during analysis and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre and post conditions can be used to declare what changes but not how it changes. We saw their use in use case descriptions. They may also be used to describe the behavior of an operation in an individual component. (For example, a method in a class.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stepwise Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful technique for creating a modular structure is called stepwise refinement. It is similar to the old divide-and-conquer approach to problem solving. If you are faced with a problem that is too hard to solve, we break it into a collection of smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we can solve those. If not, we can repeat the process to break these problems down into even smaller problems. Eventually we can solve the whole thing by combining all of the solutions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stepwise refinement, our goal is to implement a specification. The starting specification is the requirement specification for the system. For any specification, we devise an implementation that typically involves the use of lower level components, whose specifications must be invented. Thus we end up with more specifications to implement in subsequent steps of the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/03.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a pictorial representation of stepwise refinement. We start with a specification. We implement it in terms of lower level modules, which we specify. Now we have more specifications to implement. We implement the specifications using this same process, one at a time. At the lowest level, we may decide that the capability can be achieved without inventing other lower level modules, and the stepwise refinement process stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "That covers the three dimensions of specification: structure, information and behavior. Next we will revisit some of the analysis and design principles we introduced in the first module of this course.\n",

    "# 7G: Analysis and Design Principles: Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the first module of this course we introduced several software engineering principles. We’d like to focus in on three main principles that will help us with analysis and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity means breaking something complicated into pieces, making things more manageable. Abstraction is where we model the essential properties of something that might otherwise be quite complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the separation of information about a module into two parts, a specification, which is an abstraction of what its capabilities are, and an implementation, which hides the details of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at modularization first. One way to look at modularization is decomposing complex things into a number of simpler pieces. This is the traditional divide-and-conquer approach to problem solving that we mentioned in the previous video. The other way to view modularization is composing big things out of components. Think of the way that we put together personal computers these days. They are made up of components such as memory boards, hard drives, video boards, keyboards, monitors, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these components is designed to fit together with the other components to build a bigger piece of equipment. We can think of this analogy to building software out of reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider software being assembled out of components, we see that there are several benefits that accrue.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, instead of thinking of our software as being made up of thousands or millions of lines of code, we can view it as being made up of orders of magnitude fewer pieces – components or modules, each of which is made to fit together with other modules, much like Legos fit together. If you remember our discussion of complexity in the first module, you can see that modularization will result in a reduction in software complexity (which was one of the leading causes of the so called software crisis).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed earlier in the course, the cost of developing a piece of software goes up exponentially with the size of the software. Thus, it is easier to build each of the components separately and then integrate them together to build the system, than it is to try to build the entire system as one giant whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply the principles of abstraction and encapsulation when designing our system of modules, then later on, it should be easier to make changes to the software. The system is less complex because there are a small number of well-defined dependencies among the components. This also means that a change to one component may not result in the typical ripple effect we used to see when we visualized our system as being built out of a whole bunch of lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are designing our system, if we specify each of the modules with an eye to making sure they will fit together properly when we do the integration, then we should be able to go off and implement each of the modules separately. We could even have different teams of people work on different modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the way cars are designed and built. Various subsystems, such as engines, transmissions, carburetors, seats, radios, etc., all have standard specifications. In this way, the manufacturer can buy the subsystems from various suppliers and integrate the subsystems together in the assembly line. There may actually be various vendors that can supply the same part. Later on, if one of the parts has a problem, we can just go to the auto parts store and buy a replacement part, possibly made by another manufacturer. It fits because there is a standard specification for the part. This is the way we should be building software – out of pieces with well-defined specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/06.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "What, exactly, is a module? It could be something as small as a method or function. It could be as large as a subsystem. In object-oriented systems, the modules are usually classes. At a higher level, a package is a collection of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unifying thing about these various kinds of modules is that a module specifies a well-defined interface. The modules are connected together by these interfaces. Think of the analogy of a computer being made up of components all with standardized interface specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/07.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we view a system as a collection of modules, we have to weigh the cost of specifying and building the modules against the cost of integrating them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will remember from our discussion of cost estimation, the amount of effort to build a module is exponentially related to the size of the module. That way it would make sense to build the system out of a whole lot of really small, simple modules. We just add up the costs to build all of the modules. The sum of the costs to build the modules would be less than the cost to build a smaller number of very large modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there is a cost to integrating the modules together. This would encourage us to build the system out of a small number of modules, each of which would be large. The integration costs also go up exponentially with the number of modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add together the development costs and integration costs, we see that what we have is sort of a bathtub effect. There is a region of lower total cost. We could call this the baby bear effect. Not too many really small modules and not too few really big ones. A moderate number of moderate size modules is just right.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/08.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we shouldn’t determine the ideal module size by counting things like lines of code or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a “right size” for a module that is determined by its properties. The two main properties that matter are **high cohesion and low coupling**. If you remember, cohesion refers to how well a module “hangs together.” We know that a module holds information and performs behaviors. There is a right way to partition out the information and behaviors to modules and there is a wrong way. The right way is to put things that are related into a module. Adding unrelated information or behavior to a module reduces is cohesion. Removing essential information or behavior from a module also reduces its cohesiveness. Some modules will naturally be large and some will naturally be small. It is the cohesion that matters, not size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other property that we should be concerned with is the coupling between modules. We should design the modules so that they have standardized interfaces, much like the way we design the components that make up computers or cars, for example. This tends to reduce the complexity of the system by reducing the strength and number of dependencies.\n",

    "# 7H: Analysis and Design Principles: Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/09.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the second of the three analysis and design principles that we will be discussing here. As you know, abstraction means to highlight the essential properties of something. Of course, there may be many abstractions for something, depending on the properties one wants to highlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder if abstract art applies this same principle. Yes, it does. An abstract painting highlights the properties of something that the artist things are important. When this picture was shown at the 1913 Armory show in New York, it caused quite a stir. It is an example of Cubism, which is an art form that abstracts out essential properties as geometric shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/10.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If abstraction means that we highlight the essential properties of something, then it follows that the inessential details are suppressed, or hidden. This hiding of the details is called encapsulation. We’ll talk about that later. Let’s focus on how we highlight the essential properties of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "We frequently use models to do this. Consider, for example, the atom. In 1913, the Danish physicist, Niels Bohr, devised the familiar model of the atom as a nucleus with protons and neutrons with electrons spinning around in orbits. It appealed to the notions of Newtonian mechanics that governed things like planetary motions. This model was pretty much determined to be inaccurate based on the later understanding of quantum mechanics, which Bohr himself contributed to. So, if this model is not really the way the atom works, why do we still teach it in Chemistry classes? The reason is that it helps us to understand basic chemical reactions, why certain things combine chemically and why other things do not. We can use it to explain the organization of the periodic table of the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a model doesn’t really need to be transparent at all. It is simply an illusion that helps us to understand something that might otherwise be quite complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/11.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed earlier in this module, analysis and design are modeling exercises. We use models of data and models of behavior to explain the essential properties of software modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a module as having two parts: a specification and an implementation. The specification answers the WHAT question: What does the module do? What information does it manage? What is the interface for invoking its behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation answers the HOW question: How does it work? We will discuss the implementation in the next video, on encapsulation. The important thing to remember is that the specification is an abstraction that makes it easier to understand the module and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/12.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "I just want to point out that abstraction is a relative term. You can’t just say that something is abstract. You can only say that something is more (or less) abstract than something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I ask you, “Is println abstract?” Your answer would depend on who you were. As you can see here, we can implement higher and higher levels of abstraction on top of the println. In that case, it’s pretty concrete. On the other hand, if you were a systems programmer, say implementing a compiler or operating system, println would be an abstraction. You would have to make it work in terms of operating system details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third principle that we will discuss is encapsulation, also sometimes referred to as information hiding or implementation hiding. The point is that we are separating out the WHAT from the HOW.\n",

    "The third analysis and design principle that we want to cover is encapsulation. So far we have talked about modularization, where we break the system up into modules, abstraction where we provide a model of what each module does. Now we will discuss how the module hides the details of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of something that has an abstract interface and a complex implementation. I have a microwave that has a really simple interface. I can operate by pushing a single button. Now I’m not an electronics engineer, but I know that there’s a lot of very complicated equipment inside the microwave that makes it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the average person, a microwave is something we use to heat things. Very few people know how microwaves really work. Is that a problem? NO. We don’t need to know how a microwave works in order to use it. That’s due to a combination of encapsulation (hiding the complexity from the world) and abstraction (giving us a simplified interface so we can use the microwave).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/14.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just so we’re clear: encapsulation is the separation of the specification from the implementation. Abstraction is the way we describe the specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In encapsulation, then, a module has these two views: the outside view, or specification, that describes WHAT the module does and how to use it, and the inside view, or implementation, that describes HOW the module does what we say it does. One of the original proponents of this idea was David Parnas, who wrote the seminal papers on modularization in the early 1970’s. I should also point out additional work that was done on cohesion and coupling by Glenford Myers later in that decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re both in Wikipedia. One of the things that Parnas talks about it that the implementation of a module should hide what he refers to as secrets. These secrets don’t need to be exposed to users of the module. One of the benefits of this is that if the details of one of these secrets changed, it would only affect the module that encapsulated that secret.\n",
    "\n",

    "This brings us to this quote. This is something that I’ve often said. Software is a lot like magic. When I was a kid I was interested in performing magic tricks. I had my little magic set and put on shows for the neighbors. Software works like magic because there’s the illusion and then there’s the secret trick of how it’s done.\n",

    "One of the architectural patterns involves the relationships between clients and servers. This actually applies to any relationship between clients and servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients know who the servers are. They know how to access the services of the servers. This is advertised by the servers and is publicly visible. The servers don’t know the clients. The behavior of a server should not in any way depend on who the client is. Servers should be equal opportunity providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clients don’t know how the servers work. This is encapsulation, pure and simple. Servers don’t know how the clients work, either. This sort of goes along with the second point. Servers don’t know anything about the clients. This is like encapsulation in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/16.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least three benefits from encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, since the complex details of how the server works are encapsulated and the module provides a simple abstract specification, the server appears to the client to be simple. This results in simple clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal secrets in the server can be protected because they are hidden. If the server encapsulates information, the information can’t be accessed directly by other modules. They must use the services of the module doing the encapsulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the module encapsulates a secret implementation, any modifications to that secret implementation are not visible to the outside. As long as the module provides the behavior as advertised in the specification, the implementation can be changed without affecting any of the clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/17.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing. We know we have a correct module if the implementation does what the specification says it will. This can be the basis for inspections or testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod072/18.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our discussion of the software crisis in the first module of this class? We said that the main cause of the problems we were facing was the overwhelming complexity of the software, and that the complexity continued to grow as time went on. We said that software was complex because any line of code could theoretically have a dependency on any other line of code.\n",

The other is to minimize the number of possible dependencies between modules. Modularization, abstraction and encapsulation taken together achieve this effect. They provide our best hope of controlling the software crisis.\n",
