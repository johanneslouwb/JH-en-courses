    "# 8G: Classes and Object Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will discuss how classes and object instances are documented in the Unified Modeling Language, UML.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/01.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "UML uses a three part box to document a class. The top part contains the name of the class (centered, in bold font). The middle part contains a list of the attributes (normal font, left justified). The bottom part contains a list of the operations (normal font, left justified).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/02.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The information from the CRC cards may be used to fill in some of the attributes and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the responsibility of an object is to know something, that usually maps to an attribute. But be careful. If the thing the object knows is another object, then this would be modeled by something called a link. We’ll cover links in just a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the responsibility of an object is to be able to do something, that usually maps to an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/03.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also model object instances in UML. An instance is a two part box. The bottom part consists of a list of its attribute names and their values, separated by equals signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of what goes in the top box looks similar to a variable declaration in UML: a variable name, followed by a colon, followed by the type of the variable. (By the way this syntax is borrowed from the languages Ada and Pascal, in case you were wondering.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This line is written in underlined font. The name that appears to the left of the colon represents the reference or pointer to the object instance. In object oriented design, we will assign this reference value to variables, and pass it as an argument to operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In analysis, we generally don’t worry about the references. In fact, we typically don’t even show anything to the left of the colon. That is, we elide the object reference name, and just show the colon and the name of the class of the object instance in the top box. This is called an anonymous object instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an object instance diagram. For one class diagram, there may be many object instance diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two object instances are physically connected, we say that they are linked. We discovered some of the links when we did CRC modeling. When we said that one object “knew” about another object, this is a link. In an object instance diagram, we represent a link as a line drawn between the two object instances. A link is a semantic relationship between two object instances. It represents information that is jointly held by the two objects. Here we see two object instances. One is an instance of the class State. The other is an instance of the class City.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link is shown as a line connecting the two object instances. Notice that the link is annotated with the semantic information shared by the two objects. We see attribute values represented in the object instances. The “Capital is” information is not an attribute of just the state or just the city. It is shared by the two objects. That’s why it’s represented by the link connecting the two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "When links may exist between object instances, we say that there is an association between their corresponding classes. In the class diagram, we represent associations by lines drawn between the classes. The line is labeled with a name indicating the semantic information contained in the links. The diagram you see here shows two classes and an association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no values for the attributes are shown, because these are classes, not object instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things to remember about links in the analysis model. First, links are not directional. We might like to represent them as arrows, but, as we will see when we get to design, an arrow indicates that a decision has been made about where the link information will be stored. That’s a design decision, so we don’t use arrows in our analysis model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might notice that the name of the association implies a direction. The association only reads correctly in one direction. Maryland’s capital is Annapolis. It doesn’t make sense to say the Annapolis’s capital is Maryland. That doesn’t mean that the link is directional, though. The link information is just as much a part of the City object as it is the State object. So what do we do about the fact that the association name only makes sense when you read it one direction? The convention that is usually adopted is that the association name should read properly left to right or top down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you will draw your class diagrams so the associations are either horizontal or vertical, so this rule is easy to follow. The last point to remember is that links or associations represent information. We should treat them as structural relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, try not to think of an association as a conduit for sending messages between objects. Any object should be able to send a message to any other object it needs to, regardless of whether there is a link connecting the objects. All you need in order to send a message is a reference to the object you want to send the message to. This reference can be passed around as a piece of data and doesn’t necessarily need to be stored as an attribute anywhere. This holds true for both analysis and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/06.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need to pick a name for an association, the name of the information being stored will give you a clue. Use a verb or verb phrase. The information contained in the link can be determined by reading the class names with the association name between them. We saw this in the previous example. The class names were State and City, and the association name was “capital is.” This reads sort of like a sentence: State capital is City. Another example might be the “represented by” association connecting the State and Senator classes.\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/07.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of object instances that may be linked is indicated by the multiplicity notation near the ends of the association line. The symbol indicates the number of instances of the class that may be linked to an instance of the class at the other end of the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/08.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If a fixed number of instances of a class may be linked to an instance of the class on the other end of the association, put that number near the end of the line. In this diagram, each senator is a member of one US Senate. The Senate has 100 members.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/09.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number is arbitrary, put an asterisk at the end of the line. If the number is a range of values, use “subrange” (double dot) notation. The subrange 0..1 is special, and it indicates that the link is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/10.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarification, we may indicate the role that an object plays in an association relationship. The role is annotated on the association line at the end near the object playing the role. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have both multiplicity and role names vying for space towards the end of the association line. Some tools will help with the placement of these artifacts, while others are a bit more free form. The UML rules simply say that these annotations go near the end of the association, but are not specific about exact placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/11.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In UML, you can add a comment to any modeling element. If we put the comment inside curly braces, it is referred to as a property of the modeling element. The property is placed near the modeling element to which it applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also put comments inside dog-eared boxes, and draw a dashed line to the modeling element to which the comment refers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly useful type of comment is a constraint. Just as their name implies, constraints constrain or restrict information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/12.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that information is represented in a Class diagram in two forms: Attribute values, and links. So a constraint can be a property that restricts the value of an attribute or an association.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that multiplicities are a form of constraint. They have the effect of constraining the number of links that can be created, particularly multiplicities that have fixed lower or upper bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints are usually expressed in mathematical or logic notation, but natural language may be used if the math is too hard to understand. There is a formal notation that is part of the UML called OCL: Object Constraint Language. The advantage of OCL is that it can be processed by a CASE tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of constraints involve two rules:\n",
    "- First: Whenever an object instance is constructed, the constraints must be true. \n",
    "- Second: Any operation on an object or link that changes its value must preserve the constraint.\n",

    "\n",
    "One class, the part, represents pieces that are owned by the other class, the whole, or composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UML notation for a composition relationship is a line with a solid diamond on the end toward the composite class. Although it is an association, an association name is not necessary. Neither are role names. The meaning of the association is “composed of” and is indicated by the diamond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the diagram here, a dictionary entry consists of some number of definitions. Each definition also includes a collection of synonyms, and an optional etymology. The synonyms and etymology are parts of the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite is an abstraction that stands in for all its parts. The dictionary entry IS all of its definitions. A definition IS its synonyms and etymology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite object encapsulates the part objects. Client objects deal with the composite object rather than the parts individually. This means that the composite will have to have operations that may be invoked by client objects that, in turn, invoke operations on the encapsulated part objects, since those part objects are not really visible outside the composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to tell if a composition is appropriate is the cascading delete rule: If the composite goes away, so do its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the lifetime of the parts is controlled by the composite. The parts are created by the composite, and the parts are destroyed by the composite. The composite has exclusive use of the parts. No object other than the composite may send messages to any of the part objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod082/14.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If not all of these constraints apply to your situation, but you still want to express a part- whole relationship, you may use what is called an Aggregation relationship in UML.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship is indicated by an open diamond on the end toward the aggregator class. An aggregation is simply a collection, but the parts are not necessarily encapsulated within the aggregator. An object may be part of multiple different aggregations, something that is not allowed in composition. In this example we see what is called a recursive aggregation. An object instance of Shape can be made up of other object instances of Shape. We wouldn’t want to make this a composition relationship because we would want to be able to send messages to any of the shapes in the hierarchy without having to send the message to the top level object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some properties shared by both compositions and aggregations.\n",
    "- **Transitive** – If a handle is part of a door, and a door is part of a car, then a handle is part of a car.\n",
    "- **Anti-symmetric** – If a door is part of a car, then a car cannot be part of a door.\n",
    "- **The aggregate or composite** may have some attributes or operations of its own, in addition to those in the part objects. A composite or aggregate is greater than just the sum of its parts.\n",
