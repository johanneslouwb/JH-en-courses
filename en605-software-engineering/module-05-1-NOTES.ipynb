    "Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) deals with these issues, including modes of operation, usage styles, and human factors. Usability engineering works in parallel with software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we interact with computers has evolved from a model where the hardware pretty much dictated the mode of interaction to today, where the user is the most important.\n",

    "# 5B - Usability Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability engineering is a true engineering discipline, sharing the same characteristics as other engineering disciplines we have discussed. It is aimed at producing practical results using a repeatable process based on scientific principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the underpinnings of usability engineering is the **science of psychology**. It has to do with the human mind and physiology.\n",
    "\n",
    "UI Engineering works in parallel with other engineering disciplines: systems engineering, hardware engineering and software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in other engineering disciplines, there is a repeatable process that UI engineers follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **usability requirements analysis**. The main question to be answered here is, “What are the users’ needs?” We investigate this using many of the same techniques that we discussed in our module on software requirements elicitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next phase is **usability analysis and design**. This is analogous to software analysis and design. Usability analysts start with the usability requirements and determine what user interface features need to be built. Usability design is the process of figuring out how those features will be built in the software and hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then there is **usability testing**. The main question here is, “How successful is the mapping from the implementation view to the user’s view?” In other words, does the way the user interface really work match the way the users think it should work? A lot of the usability testing is based on psychological testing techniques. One kind of usability testing is called alpha testing. Most people know what beta testing is. The name begs the question: is there such a thing as alpha testing? Yes there is. In beta testing the system is tested in the user’s actual environment with real users doing real work. Alpha testing is done in the developer’s location under controlled conditions. Real users are recruited for this testing. They are given tasks to perform and then are observed as they attempt to execute the tasks. If the testers observe that these typical users have difficulty using the product, they can modify the user interface and quickly test the changes to see if the test subjects improve their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just as for software requirement or hardware requirements, usability requirements have to be testable. They may be specified in their own document, or they may be included in one of the other requirement specification documents. It depends on whether the user interface involves hardware mechanisms or if it’s just a software interface such as a graphical user interface. In any event, **usability requirements are stated as non-functional requirements**. This means that they don’t describe what the system does, but they merely describe ways of getting the system to do what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-functional usability requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical examples of these non-functional usability requirements are these:\n",
    "* **Effectiveness** – can the users be effective when they perform their tasks? Does the interface make the system useful for them?\n",
    "* **Efficiency** – can the users perform their tasks without unnecessary work? Does it make their tasks easy to perform? In other words, will the users find it easier to use the system with this user interface than with other possible user interface choices?\n",
    "* **Safety** – does the user interface make it impossible to do some sort of damage: to equipment, to people, to data, to money, to communication, and so forth?\n",
    "* **Utility** – is the system useful? Or does it get in the way of the users doing their work?\n",
    "* **Learnability** – how much training is required in order to become effective at using the system? Does classroom training become part of the requirements? Of course, the less training required the better. Consider most apps that are being developed these days. They should be designed so that it is almost obvious how to use them and that no training should be required.\n",
    "* **Memorability** – this applies to software that is used infrequently. A good example is income tax software. For people who do their own taxes, they use it for a couple of weeks once a year. They don’t want to have to spend much time re-learning how to use it each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Experience Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also user experience goals. These are harder to measure, so they may not be stated as non-functional requirements. They are just goals that we would like to aim for.\n",
    "Some examples are these: Examples:\n",
    "* **Satisfying** – does the user get a feeling of satisfaction from using the system?\n",
    "* **Enjoyable** – is it, in fact, a feeling of enjoyment?\n",
    "* **Fun** – does the user have fun using the system? This isn’t necessarily a goal for all systems, such as business systems, but we don’t want them to feel like drudgery, either.\n",
    "* **Entertaining** – can using the system be a source of entertainment for the user?\n",
    "* **Helpful** – does the system help the user with the steps involved in performing tasks? Ways in which a system can be helpful are providing a help menu, tool tips, and other on-screen guidance.\n",
    "* **Motivating** – does the user feel motivated to use the system? This is more than just using the system because they have to or it makes their job easier. It’s because they like to use the system, and feel motivated to do so.\n",
    "* **Aesthetically pleasing** – this is one of those psychological aspects. It has to do with screen layout, use of color, sound, motion, etc.\n",
    "* **Supportive of creativity** – we will discuss this later in the module. The user should feel as though they are in charge of the system rather than being just a responder to prompts from the system.\n",
    "* **Rewarding** -- one form of motivation is that the user actually receives rewards from using the system.\n",
    "* **Emotionally fulfilling** – this is a deeper psychological goal than the others. It is hard to quantify or measure, but you know it when you experience it.\n",

    "# 5C - Usability Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with analyzing usability requirements to determine the best way for users to interact with the system.\n",
    "Then these interactions are designed in terms of software and hardware. Later on, the user interface is implemented as part of the code development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of possible techniques for analyzing the usability requirements for a system and specifying the appropriate modes of user interaction. We will discuss four such techniques here.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Interviewing**\n",
    "2) **Brainstorming**\n",
    "3) **Field Studies**\n",
    "4) **Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1) Interviewing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of an interview is to gain an understanding of the problem from the point of view of the interviewee. It’s important to interview the right stakeholders as well as to choose the right interviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders that can provide the most beneficial information are probably the eventual users of the system. There may be many different types of users, and they may have different perspectives. We should try to interview enough of them so we get a complete picture of how the system is expected to be used. Other people that could be interviewed are the sponsors of the system. They can tell you what their expectations are. If the system is replacing an existing system, it is helpful to interview people who use that system to find out what improvements they would like to see. The danger here is that their perception of the user interaction is biased by the current system, and it may be hard for them to think outside the box. This is especially true if the existing system is a manual system that will be replaced by a computerized system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to choose the right interviewer. This person should have enough knowledge about the domain that they can understand the answers to the questions and ask good follow-up questions, but not enough knowledge that they might unconsciously bias the results of the interview. We are trying to find out what the person being interviewed thinks, and not the interviewer. You can see this if you watch people doing interviews on TV. A really inexperienced interviewer will have a list of questions to ask and won’t deviate from the list regardless of what the person says. The interviewer doesn’t really add any value. The good interviewers do more listening than talking. They might ask an introductory question, but the rest of their questions are based on what the interviewee says. You don’t want to rely on just one or two interviews. You need to listen to enough people so that you get a complete picture, and individual bias does not sway the conclusions too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) Brainstorming:\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is useful when no one has much of an idea of how things should work. Brainstorming is a group dynamic approach to coming up with ideas that would not likely have presented themselves if the people were working by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brainstorming has two phases. During **phase 1**, we pose a problem to be solved. Then each of the members of the group will suggest solutions to the problem. The ideas are recorded so that everyone can see them. There is no discussion or evaluation of the ideas during this phase. The goal is to collect as many ideas as possible. The reason that we record the ideas so that everyone can see them is that something that is suggested by one person might provide the spark for an idea by someone else. Without that spark, that person might never have thought of the idea.\n",
    "After some amount of time the process will seem to slow down. At that point, we go to **phase 2**. During phase 2, the ideas are organized into categories. Similar ideas are combined. Really any ideas might be discarded. There might be some kind of evaluation process or even voting to identify the best ideas.\n",
    "Studies have shown over and over again that groups doing brainstorming almost always out- perform individuals working separately at coming up with the best answers to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) Field Studies:\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is useful when we are replacing an existing system, particularly if we are automating a manual process. We send out a team of analysts to study how things are done currently. The analysts will document the business processes. Many times, the people working in the business are not even aware of the business process until they are shown the business process model by the analysts. In fact, the people have been working so long in the business that the processes have become very inefficient, without them really knowing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a model of the business process, we can identify opportunities for automating parts of the process. This will lead to an understanding of the requirements for user interactions to the systems doing the automating.\n",
    "We have to be careful if we are replacing one automated system with another. You don’t want to make really radical changes to the interactions, but you do want to take advantage of newer ways of interacting with systems. For example, we might want to replace a command line user interface with a point and click interface. Have you ever noticed how many systems still use monochrome text based interaction technology that was in use back in the 1970’s? I’m thinking of a lot of government systems. Or the airline reservation system. (What is it that the agents are typing into the system whenever I want to make a change to my ticket?) But much of the time the users have gotten so used to using the old outdated system that they have a hard time (at first) getting used to the new way of operating. You can expect initial dissatisfaction with the new interaction style.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (4) Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "The last technique is to generate operational scenarios. These are models of how the users will interact with the system. These scenarios are like prototypes of the system. They provide us with ways to study various options or ideas. The prototypes may be at varying levels of fidelity.\n",

    "# 5D - Usability Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the process of figuring out how to bridge the gap between how the user wants to use the system and the capabilities provided by the system implementers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **user’s mental model** is based on the user’s goals for using the system. It may be based on experience with similar systems, perhaps even a prior version of the system under development. It may be based on similar systems that the users may be familiar with. The mental model may be just based on the way the user accomplishes things in real life. The system interface should imitate the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **designer’s model** is described in terms of mechanisms offered by the system implementation. Of course the system won’t be able to provide any functionality that is not implemented in the code. The interface must provide access to those functions and information that are provided by the software. The job of usability design is to build a bridge between the capabilities provided by the software to the needs of the users. This bridge may be built in either direction, depending on what came first. If the software hasn’t been built yet, the user needs are used as inputs to the software requirements. The bridge is built from the user’s model to the designer’s model. On the other hand, if the software already exists and our job is to provide an interface to make it easy for the users to access the capabilities of the software then the bridge is built the other direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the best approach would be to create both models as well as the bridge at the same time.\n",
    "Sometimes this mapping between the user’s model and the designer’s model is accomplished through the use of metaphors\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players...\" Shakespeare\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a metaphor. One type of metaphor is called a simile. A simile is an analogy or comparison. It usually contains the word, like. For example, we might say that the interface to an audio player app is like a CD player. It has buttons that look just like those on a CD player, and they function in an analogous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Desktop Metaphors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some familiar desktop metaphors: The computer screen is like a desktop with familiar objects such as calendars, clocks, file folders, and so forth. Their purpose is obvious and they don’t take a lot of training to be able to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UI Metaphors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical user interfaces, or GUIs, have adopted some metaphors as well. Here are some examples: the little up-down arrows are called spin buttons. There are slider controls, check boxes and radio buttons. These are ubiquitous and their behavior is obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skeuomorphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes user interface designers go out of their way to emphasize the metaphor by artistically designing the interaction mechanisms to look realistic. This is referred to as skeuomorphism (think of the amps in amplitude or native instruments etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cognitive Distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive Distance -- The decisions made by the user are guided by the user’s conceptual model. How does the user interpret:\n",
    "* What operations are available?\n",
    "* What the system state is?\n",
    "* Whether the last operation was successful?\n",
    "* What information is being displayed?\n",
    "* How to navigate to another part of the dialog?\n",
    "* What to do next?\n",
    "\n",
    "The designer’s model is conveyed and supported by the user interface as implemented in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully there is congruence between the user’s mental model and the HCI designer’s model. The **degree of congruence between the two models is called the cognitive distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The closer the mapping between the user’s mental model and the designer’s model, the easier it is for the user to identify and achieve the system goals. That’s why it is most desirable to develop the user’s model and the designer’s model, as well as the mapping between the two, at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usability Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "The usability design process involves describing three aspects of the interaction. We can use scenarios or prototypes to explore these aspects of the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Activity scenarios** – show how the users carry out their goals. We can use UML use cases or activity diagrams for these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Information scenarios** – show how information is exchanged between the users and the system. Screen layout prototypes are useful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Interaction scenarios** – show the details of how the user and the system interact. Once again, a prototype, either low fidelity or high fidelity, can be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several aspects of the user interface that can be prototyped.\n",
    "- **Input Controls**: These are ways to allow the user to present information to the system. These controls include buttons, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown lists, list boxes, toggles, date fields, file selectors, and so forth.\n",
    "- **Navigational Components** provide ways for the user to control the action or the presentation of information. These controls include: breadcrumbs, sliders, search fields, pagination controls, tags, icons, and so forth.\n",
    "- **Informational Components** are mechanisms that enable the system to present information to the user. They include: tooltips, icons, progress bar, notifications, alerts, message boxes, modal windows, and so on.\n",
