    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will examine the three dimensions of software specification: \n",
    "1) structure, \n",
    "2) information and \n",
    "3) behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/01.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, we have already seen these dimensions, if you think about what we specified in the software requirements. To completely describe software, we need to specify all three dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "We view our software as being made up of components, or modules. When we describe the structure of our system, we identify the modules and specify how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module will be connected to at least one other module. This is some sort of dependency relationship. The dependency may be due to the fact that one module has some information that is needed by other modules. The dependency may also be due to the fact that one module provides some services or functions that are needed by other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module may hold some information. In the requirements we discovered what information is remembered by the system. In analysis and design we will allocate the responsibility for storing that information to individual modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The third dimension is behavior. It is what the system is able to do. The largest part of the requirements specification was involved with describing this behavior at the system level. In analysis and design we will allocate the functional capabilities to individual modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two main ways of describing behavior**. \n",
    "- **Imperative descriptions** of behavior always involve an element of time. They describe what changes occur in what sequence. These are **the most common ways of describing behavior**. Examples are \n",
    "    - use case specifications (flows of events), \n",
    "    - activity diagrams (which look like flow charts), \n",
    "    - and sequence diagrams. \n",

    "# 7C: Levels of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "In any software effort except the most trivial, there is a huge semantic gap between the description of the problem to be solved, and the code that will hopefully solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to jump the semantic gap in one step, you are applying what is sometimes called the **big bang approach** to software development. It almost never ends well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is much better to take a careful step by step approach to the development of software. We do this one level of abstraction at a time. We see four main levels of abstraction in this development process. They are illustrated in this graphic. Let’s look at each level individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/02.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a description of the problem to be solved by the software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical mistake that a lot of people make is to do what I call “jumping to solution.” Instead of describing the problem to be solved, we describe solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When customers bring us in to help them solve a problem, they frequently suggest solutions. Our first job should be to ask a simple question: “WHY?” What is the problem you are trying to solve? Other times we will try to force fit a solution to the customer’s problem. We don’t take the time to understand the problem completely. We make assumptions that may or may not be accurate. We have jumped to solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things are not going to go very well if we proceed to writing requirements for a system that doesn’t solve the customer’s real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirement Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we understand the problem to be solved, we can specify the solution as a requirements specification. In the requirements, we view the system as a black box. We know there is going to be some code in there eventually, but our job in requirements is to describe WHAT the structure, information and behavior are, rather than HOW they are implemented. (That’s analysis and design.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Model\n",
    "\n",
    "During analysis, we open the covers of the black box and peer inside. Our job is to find the data and functional components inside the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We view analysis as a discovery process. There are two ways of gaining new information. One is invention and one is discovery. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. It never existed until he invented it. George Priestly discovered oxygen. It always existed, but no one knew about it until he discovered it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data and functional components that we identify during analysis are discovered rather than invented. Different teams doing analysis starting with the same set of requirements, will typically discover the same set of information and functional components. There’s not a lot of room for creativity in analysis. Our job is to find the components inside the system rather than to invent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A technique that is sometimes useful is called noun-verb analysis. The nouns that appear in the requirements and problem statement indicate the things in the problem. Frequently these things reflect the names of the components in the analysis. They also may indicate the information that is managed by the components inside the system. The verbs that we use indicate the functions performed by the components inside the system. This technique works best when used informally. I wouldn’t be too pedantic about it. You will find that in a typical set of requirements there are way too many nouns and verbs. You can easily get swamped if you try to deal with every noun and verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "During analysis, after finding the components we model their relationships. There are two types of relationships between components. Static relationships show the structure of the solution. Dynamic models show what happens when the system is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m using a football analogy here. The static model shows where each player is positioned at the start of the play. There is no movement here. It is purely structural.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic model shows what happens over time. The diagram shows where each player is supposed to move, and who has the ball when, and whether the ball is carried or passed and received.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We view the analysis model as a lower level of specification. If the requirements specify the system as one large black box, the analysis models identify the components within the system and show their specifications. The requirements show WHAT the structure, information and behavior are for the entire system. The analysis identifies WHAT the components inside the system are, WHAT their structural relationships are, and WHAT their information and behavioral properties are.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the analysis is a refinement of the requirements. But the analysis is still a specification model. Design should be thought of as an abstract model of the code. It describes HOW the code works. Design is an invention process. For each component specification in the analysis, we need to invent an implementation. There may be many choices for implementing each analysis component. Different teams my come up with different designs given the same analysis model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Analysis and Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a good quote from Michael Jackson (not that Michael Jackson). He is a British software engineer. The beginning of wisdom for a computer programmer is to recognize the difference between getting a program to work and getting it RIGHT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can hack at a program long enough to eventually get something to work well enough to get it out the door. But it probably won’t be easy to understand, or maintain, or use. It will probably have low reliability. The customers will most likely be dissatisfied. (Remember our discussion of the software crisis?)\n",

    "# 7D: Structure Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to look in more detail at how we model structure, information and behavior. Let’s start with structure modeling. We’ll see that there are several stereotypical structures that appear over and over in software (and in real life).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/03.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most ubiquitous structure in the hierarchy. We can view this structure as a graph in which there are no cycles. In other words, there is no path from any node back to itself. This is referred to as a lattice structure in graph theory. It is possible to draw a lattice so that all of the edges point in the same direction. In the diagram shown here, the edges all point downwards. In doing so, the nodes fall into tiers or layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a special case of a lattice in which each node has only one parent. This is called a tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see hierarchies all over. A hierarchy could represent the dependencies between functions. It could represent the inheritance structure in an object oriented system. It could represent part-whole data structures. Directory structures are hierarchical.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes hierarchies so appealing is that they mimic structures we encounter every day. Typical organizational structures in, for example, the military, are hierarchies. The dependencies all flow in the same direction. We frequently organize information in a hierarchical fashion. For example, recall from biology, we organize properties of living things into kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layered\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we view a system as being made up of components or modules, it might be useful to organize those components into layers based on their reuse characteristics. We see at the base layer a lot of rather small components that do very specific things. These are the capabilities that are typically found in programming language class libraries or in the operating system. They are not specific to any particular domain and are highly reusable. Examples of base layer components might be collection classes, UI builder components, or networking capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components in the next layer up are what we might call common services. These components still have quite broad reuse potential. They don’t come from languages or operating systems, so they must be built on top of the language and operating system facilities. Examples of common services might be message queueing facilities or database access capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next layer up consists of domain specific components. These are built especially for implementing systems in particular domains. Much of the time these components are harvested from existing systems and are sort of polished up to make them more reusable. The reuse potential for one of these components is not as great as for components in lower layers, but the return on investment of its reuse is quite high. We might see domain specific components for specialized domains such as banking or insurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The top layer is the application layer. These are not really reusable components. They represent the systems that are built using the capabilities of all of the components in the layers below them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, just like in the hierarchical organization, all dependencies are downward. You would never have a component in a lower layer be dependent on one in a higher layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layered architectures are quite common in computing. Think about TCP-IP or the OSI framework, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general graph structure is what we might call a network. **It is different from a lattice in that it can’t always be structured in layers**. It may even have cyclic dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network structures are more common than you might think. All of the UML models that have nodes and edges (such as state transition diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams) are networks. We will look in more detail at these models later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious example of a network in computing systems is the Internet. Computing nodes are connected by communication links.\n",

    "\n",
    "The second dimension of software specification is information. Let’s look at some ways to model information within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity Relationship Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/06.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "A course grained view of the data can be represented by an entity relationship diagram, or ERD. The notation shown here was developed by Peter Chen in 1976, and is sometimes called Chen notation. The boxes represent entities, about which the system must store information. The diamonds are called relationships. Each relationship relates two entities. The symbols on the ends of the lines denote cardinality. The variant shown here was developed by James Martin for a technology called Information Engineering. For example, on the relationship, “Builds,” one manufacturer builds multiple cars. Each car is built by one manufacturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation has been superseded by the Unified Modeling Language for the most part. So let’s look at the same diagram in UML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML Class Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/07.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a UML class diagram. The relationships are designated by lines connecting the boxes. The boxes represent the classes of information. The cardinalities are called multiplicities in UML, and are represented by numbers. A star indicates a multiplicity greater than one. If you look at the “builds” relationship between Manufacturer and Car, you can see that one manufacturer can build many cars, but each car is built by one manufacturer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional information is included in the UML class diagram. For each class, not only do we see its name, but we also see its attributes and operations. In Chen notation, attributes would be represented as boxes with an elliptical shape attached to the entities. The operations are only shown on UML class diagrams, and are not present in entity-relationship diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod071/08.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "On a lower level, we need to be able to describe the properties of the information contained within a module or component, without getting into the design of the data. We will use mathematical models of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the information contained in a module is a collection that doesn’t need to be ordered, the collection can usually be modelled as a set. The elements within the set would all be of the same type (or class), so the set is homogenous. One thing about a set in mathematics is that there are no duplicate values within the set. So, for instance, if we have a set of integers, there could be at most one five in the set. Of course there is no left to right ordering of the elements of a set. The elements are either in the set or they’re not. One way to access the elements of a set would be to randomly select an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is like a set except it is ordered. The elements can be put in left to right order. Also, duplicates are allowed. If we have a list of integers, there may be any number of fives in the list. We may access the elements of a list by the first or last element. Some notations allow you to represent the first element and the remainder of the list after the first element. An array is a fixed size collection. Access to the elements is by an index value. While sets and lists have dynamic size: you can add or remove elements, an array is fixed. You can have slots in the array that don’t have any values in them, but there are still slots. A record is a collection of elements of possibly different types. Each element is accessible by a field name. We find records in older languages like Pascal or Ada. A record is similar to a struc in the C programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "A map is a key transformation data structure. There are two data types involved with a map. The first one is the key data type. The second one is the value data type. Sometimes we use the term hash map, but this implies a particular implementation, which is what we’re trying to avoid here. A typical use of the map data model is where you might have a collection of objects that are accessible by a unique name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scalar is a data model that has no sub-parts. An integer is a scalar. So is a string in many languages. There are other models that you might find in particular programming languages or design\n",
