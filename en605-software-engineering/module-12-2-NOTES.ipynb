    "# 12E: Formal Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/21.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, I’ll describe the formal inspection quality review model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspection is more formal and rigorous than the walkthrough model and it is considered to be an industry best practice for finding defects in software work products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspections have the highest defect detection rate of any defect identification technique…average defect detection rates of 60-90 percent, whereas the more informal walkthrough model averages 30-60 percent. So…what makes this model more formal? Several characteristics. There are specialized roles that some of the reviewers play, there are more steps than just the inspection meeting, there are rules for conducting the inspection meeting, and there is mandatory preparation and follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal inspection review model was originally developed at IBM and was constructed specifically to mitigate the historical problems teams experienced with quality reviews of software work products. Let’s look at this review model in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection Process Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/22.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspections require that some participants play specialized roles. There are five roles, and they are used to clearly define participant responsibilities and to help mitigate commonly encountered review problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **moderator role** is an extremely important one. The moderator is responsible for ensuring that all the steps in the inspection process are followed and that all the inspection process rules are complied with. The moderator is also responsible for facilitating the inspection meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **author** is the person (or persons) who authored the work product being inspected. The author is responsible for answering questions posed by the inspection team, for providing clarifying information, and for resolving any issues for which he or she is the designated owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issues list is a mandatory inspection work product, and the person assigned to play the **role of recorder** is responsible for logging the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next role is the most unusual one. In the informal walkthrough model, the **work product author** typically walks the review team through the work product. In the formal inspection model, someone other than the author is selected to do this. Reasons for this include putting the focus on the work product instead of the author (which can mitigate defensiveness, particularly in design and code reviews), and to get an unbiased interpretation of the work product.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a requirements inspection, in particular, this is a very important and powerful role. I recommend to my clients to pick a developer or tester for this role in requirements inspections…someone who will have to use the requirements as input to their work process. This has been very effective at increasing defect detection and uncovering ambiguous or untestable requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…the traditional name for this role is **reader**, but I recommend the name **presenter**, because it more accurately reflects what the role is all about, and because historically people have interpreted reader literally…and actually just read the work product aloud…every single word. Experience has shown that the most effective way to implement this role is to present the work product by paraphrasing chunks of material rather than reading verbatim.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first four roles are the specialized roles. Anyone else on the inspection team falls into the category of **general inspector**. Like the participants in a walkthrough, inspectors are relevant stakeholders and perhaps subject matter experts who evaluate the work product for defects and ensure the work product meets its requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in practice, it is common for one person to play more than one role. For example, the moderator may also assume the role of recorder or a general inspector. Similarly, a general inspector may also play the role of recorder. When it comes to playing multiple roles, there are two guidelines that I ask my clients to treat as rules: \n",
    "- the presenter should not play another role, and \n",
    "- the author should not play another role. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presenter role is a full-time role during the inspection meeting, and having that individual play another role will slow down the meeting momentum and make the role less effective. With regard to the author not playing another role, experience has shown that it is most important for the author to focus full attention on participant comments and issues to ensure that correct resolution takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection Process Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/23.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another inspection characteristic that distinguishes it from the informal walkthrough process is that there are more steps than just a meeting. The steps help to give the inspection process structure and repeatability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kick-off step starts the inspection process for a given work product. The author and moderator meet to verify that the work product is ready for inspection, the inspection team is selected, and the inspection meeting is scheduled. The traditional name for this step is planning, but I suggest the use of kick-off to my clients to give it the connotation that it usually takes minutes versus hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The moderator decides whether the overview step is necessary. Traditionally, this step has been used to give the inspection team project background information and orientation, but moderators can use it for whatever they want to. Some moderators, for example, will get the inspection team together to review inspection scope, objectives, and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation step is a mandatory step in the inspection process, because advance preparation is essential if the inspection meeting is to be effective. Participants are also typically asked to record and report their preparation times. The general rule of thumb is to expect preparation time to be about the same as meeting time. So, if there’s a one hour inspection meeting it’s expected that participants will spend about an hour preparing.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the inspection meeting, the work product is presented, issues are logged, and the inspection outcome is determined. The moderator is responsible for facilitating this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any issues need to be resolved, there is a rework step external to the meeting. And the moderator will appoint someone to follow-up with the issue owners to verify that the issues have been resolved. A follow- up activity may also be to re-inspect the work product if serious issues were identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection Meeting Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/24.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "A third characteristic of inspections that distinguish them from walkthroughs is that the outcomes of an inspection meeting are defined in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four basic outcomes as illustrated on the slide…accept as is, conditional acceptance, re-inspect, or the inspection is not yet finished and requires another meeting. Normally, we estimate how many meeting will be required in advance, so this outcome is usually known ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-defining the inspection meeting outcomes is a simple, but very powerful idea. The team knows, going into the meeting, that one of these outcomes will be assigned at the end of the meeting and it kind of pre-conditions peoples’ thinking. This is something that could easily be incorporated into walkthroughs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspection Impact on Defect Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/25.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier lecture, I talked about the error amplification phenomenon…uncaught defects that get through any life cycle phase are inherited by subsequent phases where some just pass thru and some cause additional defects to be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chart shows the impact that inspections can have on mitigating this phenomenon. It’s based upon data obtained from a number of projects, some of which used inspections and some of which did not. The red bars show a measure of how many defects get through each life cycle phase when inspections were not used, and the green bars show the same statistic for projects that used inspections. I plotted these to scale so that the effectiveness of inspections stand out visually. It’s easy to see the dramatic impact that inspections can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, not every organization uses inspections…nor do they need to. There’s a bit of overhead with inspections…more people are required to play the roles and its best to provide people with training so they know how to do inspections correctly. Many of my clients, following the walkthrough guidelines I talked about earlier, have achieved results very close to those of the formal inspection model without the additional overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of software quality review model used, what is most important is that it be effective at detecting and removing defects.\n",

    "# 12F: Software Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we’ll discuss some different types of software metrics and talk about how to specify software quality and measure software quality at early phases of the life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Metrics and Why do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/26.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "What are metrics, and why use them? A metric is a measurement of something. It could be a measurement of some aspect of a software process…like how many pages of requirements can be inspected per hour, or it could be some aspect of a software product…like how complicated a software component is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons to use metrics. First, metrics can provide useful visibility into project status…for example, by estimating how close to completion the project is. Another reason is to provide feedback to management, staff, and stakeholders…for example, by showing evidence that we are, in fact, building a product that satisfies a requirement that it be easy to maintain. Feedback may also be in the form of quality indicators…measurements that indicate whether a product is following good software engineering design principles, for example, or that is satisfactorily tested. Metrics can also be used to help manage and improve software processes. A good example of this can be found in the higher CMMI maturity levels that you learned about earlier in this course. So…let’s talk about some different types of metrics and how they might be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Types of Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/27.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different types of metrics that organizations use. For our discussion I’m going to break them down into three categories: process metrics, product metrics, and quality metrics. Please note in advance that the categories are not mutually exclusive when it comes to quality metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process metrics measure something associated with a process…like the total effort spent on each phase in a project life cycle, an estimate of time remaining for project completion, maybe average inspection rates (measured in, say, pages inspected per hour), and so forth. As you can see by these examples these are characteristics of various processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Product metrics measure something associated with a product…like product size (maybe in lines of code), the number of defects per thousand lines of code, or maybe the control flow complexity of a software component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality metrics measure something that is associated with the quality characteristics of a process or product. Examples include measures like the percentage of milestones satisfied on time, the defect density of a delivered product, or the percentage of code exercised under test. They are indicators of general or specific product or process quality. The remainder of this lecture will focus on examples of quality metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying and Measuring Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/28.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can measure software quality, you must be able to specify what software quality is…with respect to a specific software product. In the software engineering world there are some industry-wide practices that correlate with good software quality and that can be designed into software product components. Examples of such practices would be that a software component follow structured programming principles, that it is well-documented, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s also a whole category of non-functional requirements in software engineering that are often referred to as quality requirements. These requirements often end with “ility”…maintainability, testability, and so forth. A definition of these frequently-specified quality requirements is illustrated in this table…and many leading-edge software organizations include at least a subset of them on most projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, almost all of these definitions begin with the phrase “the extent of”…so what does that mean? Simply put, it means how easy or difficult. For example, maintainability means how easy or difficult would it be to change the product. A product with good maintainability would be a lot easier to change than a product with poor maintainability…that is, it would take less effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people would agree that these seem like desirable characteristics for many software projects. The challenge for the software engineer is how to build those characteristics into the software product and demonstrate that the product does, in fact, satisfy those requirements. Let’s see how that might be done by using metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Requirement Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/29.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This table shows where in the overall product life cycle evidence of each of the quality requirements is traditionally able to be observed. We’ll refer to this as the requirement’s visibility. And by traditionally, I mean in projects where metrics are not used. The first four columns in the table correspond to the developmental phases for the product. Operations refers to the time period the product is in production mode, maintenance refers to maintenance mode where the product will undergo changes for whatever reasons and in which the requirements, design, code, and test activities would be repeated to varying extents, and transition refers to the situation in time when the product may need to be ported to a different hardware or software platform. The X’s indicate where the visibility appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that’s pretty obvious is that…traditionally…visibility starts to occur very late in the product life cycle…during the testing phase at the earliest...and for many of the quality requirements, even later. In this situation, if a quality requirement is not met, there will be substantial rework required. And…we’ve already seen how costly that can be. Let’s compare this traditional approach to one that incorporates metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/30.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This table illustrates where metrics can be used to provide early visibility and evidence as to whether a specific quality requirement is, in fact, being built into the software product. Note that we can get visibility much earlier in the product life cycle…in all cases by the design and code phases…and in some cases as early on as the requirements phase. Now…let’s see how this can be done.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/32.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take testability as an example, and see how we\n",
    "can develop some metrics that indicate whether the\n",
    "software product is being built so that it is easy to\n",
    "test.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some attributes of a software product or a\n",
    "development process that might make testing easier?\n",
    "Let me start by listing three product attributes that\n",
    "help to make testing easier: simplicity, self-\n",
    "descriptiveness, and modularity. I’ll define them more\n",
    "precisely in a minute, so for now use your intuitive\n",
    "understanding of what you think they might mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I’ll define two more attributes that aren’t direct\n",
    "attributes of the software product itself, but have to\n",
    "do with related work products and environment. I’ll\n",
    "add traceability and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s formally define what these attributes\n",
    "mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity is a characteristic of a products design and\n",
    "code. Are they implemented in a straightforward\n",
    "manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-descriptiveness also applies to the design and\n",
    "code. Are they easy to understand by visual\n",
    "inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular applies to the design and code as well. Is it\n",
    "easy to see which components of the product\n",
    "perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three attributes help make product testing\n",
    "easier…particularly for developer-level testing,\n",
    "because they help developers understand which\n",
    "components need to be exercised to test specific\n",
    "functions and they make it easier to instrument test\n",
    "cases. They also make it easier to determine what\n",
    "needs to be fixed if tests indicate there are problems.\n",
    "Traceability has to do with the ease of relating test\n",
    "cases to the requirements that are being tested and\n",
    "to the specific product components that implement\n",
    "those requirements. Traceability helps testers\n",
    "understand which tests may need to change if a\n",
    "requirement changes, and which tests need to be re-\n",
    "run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support has to do with the infrastructure that is in\n",
    "place to support the testing effort.\n",
    "The next thing we need to do is to identify some\n",
    "metrics that can be used as indicators of these\n",
    "attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/33.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m going to just name the metrics right now, and\n",
    "discuss most of them in more detail later in this\n",
    "lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with simplicity. There are a number of\n",
    "metrics that are associated with simplicity…control\n",
    "flow complexity, coupling, cohesion, code structure,\n",
    "code size, and something called information volume.\n",
    "Most of these metrics can be applied to product\n",
    "design, and all of them can be applied to code.\n",
    "Most of the same metrics apply for measuring self-\n",
    "descriptiveness. Additionally, standards such as\n",
    "documentation and coding standards can help to\n",
    "make product components easier to understand. This\n",
    "would include things like source code documentation,\n",
    "statement of pre-conditions and post-conditions, and\n",
    "so forth…things that make code easier to read and\n",
    "understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity metrics are also pretty much the same as\n",
    "simplicity metrics, and can be applied to both design\n",
    "and code. The more modular the product is the easier\n",
    "it is to determine which components implement\n",
    "which requirements and which may need to be\n",
    "retested when test failures indicate problems.\n",
    "Traceability can be measured by using traceability\n",
    "matrices. One type of traceability matrix traces each\n",
    "requirement to the design and code components that\n",
    "implement it. This is very useful for developers as it\n",
    "helps them more easily instrument tests and\n",
    "determine what code may need to be changed if tests\n",
    "indicate problems. Another type of traceability matrix\n",
    "traces each requirement to the test cases used to\n",
    "verify that requirement. This can be very helpful to\n",
    "both developmental testers and independent testers\n",
    "in helping to determine which tests may need to be\n",
    "changed if requirements are changed and which tests\n",
    "may need to be re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of support, an effective configuration\n",
    "management process can help gain access to the\n",
    "correct versions of components that need to be\n",
    "tested. Documents such as test plans and test reports\n",
    "also help make testing easier, as well as having what\n",
    "is commonly called a test bed…a repository of tests\n",
    "that can easily be re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…in practice…we wouldn’t necessarily use all of\n",
    "these metrics…just the ones that have the most\n",
    "value-add for our particular project. What I wanted to\n",
    "demonstrate here is how metrics can be applied to\n",
    "get early insight as to whether quality characteristics\n",
    "are being built into the product.\n",

    "A very important software engineering metric that\n",

    "classification metric. Coupling is a measure of inter-\n",
    "dependence between software components. Any\n",
    "components that interact with each other are coupled\n",
    "to some degree. The more dependent components\n",
    "are on each other, the more they know about each\n",
    "other’s inner workings…the tighter the coupling. The\n",
    "less dependent they are on each other, and the less\n",
    "they know about each other’s inner workings…the\n",
    "looser the coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loose coupling is good. Tight coupling is not good.\n",
    "In practice, we want our designs to be as loosely\n",
    "coupled as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented software engineering coupling\n",
    "occurs as the result of inheritance, message\n",
    "connections, and containment. We can control\n",
    "coupling in class design by careful use of inheritance,\n",
    "avoiding unnecessary message connections and\n",
    "unnecessary containment, and by using strong\n",
    "information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional, non object-oriented software engineering coupling occurs through the use of global\n",
    "data and shared memory. We can control coupling in\n",
    "component design by avoiding the use of global data,\n",
    "avoiding passing memory address information, using\n",
    "minimal number of data parameters, and by passing\n",
    "parameters using copies of data values.\n",

    "\n",

    "Suppose we need to design an application that\n",

    "we came up with the following design. We have a\n",
    "Thermometer class that is used by a WeatherStation\n",

    "Another important classification metric is cohesion.\n",
    "Cohesion is a measure of how single-purposed or\n",
    "well-defined a software component is. The more\n",

    "### Class Cohesion\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod12/38.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example that illustrates class cohesion.\n",
    "Suppose we were designing software to implement a\n",
    "blackjack card game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this design, all the components for the blackjack\n",
    "game are modeled using a single class. The class name\n",
    "is okay, but it’s doing to much…it has low cohesion.\n",
    "For example, it is taking responsibility for modeling a\n",
    "deck of cards, modeling the playsers, shuffling the\n",
    "deck, calculating the value of a player’s hand, and so\n",
    "forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better design would model the different aspects of\n",
    "the game as separate classes. We’d have a Card class\n",
    "to model a playing card, a Deck class that would hold\n",
    "a set of cards, and so forth. Each class has high\n",
    "cohesion…each class represents a clear component\n",

    "complicated the control flow logic for a software\n",
    "component is…where a component is the equivalent\n",
    "of a function, or a subroutine in traditional\n",

    "object-oriented software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclomatic complexity can be easily calculated from\n",
    "pseudo-code or actual code. The formula is\n",

    "that would cause control flow to depart from a\n",
    "straight sequential flow…keywords like if, while, do-\n",
    "while, for, switch, case, go to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclomatic complexity impacts testability,\n",
    "maintainability, understandability, and reliability.\n",
    "McCabe and others have reported that components\n",
    "with very high complexity are likely to be\n",
    "problematic…error prone, require more testing, and\n",
    "are harder to understand and change. Software\n",
    "engineers have historically used 10 as the upper\n",
    "bound for complexity when designing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can tell you from my own work that cyclomatic\n",
    "complexity is correlated to the things I just\n",
    "mentioned. A project that I worked on for a software\n",
    "vendor client invloved analyzing about a million lines\n",
    "of code for several of the company’s software\n",

    "Here’s an example of calculating cyclomatic\n",
    "complexity for a method written in Java programming\n",
    "language. The method, named calculateGrade,\n",

    "associated letter grade, passing it back to whatever\n",
    "component called it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision keywords in this example are all if-\n",
    "statements. There are 5 of them and I’ve highlighted\n",

    "One such metric is the program knots metric, which\n",

    "but they are complicated…and for our purposes the\n",
    "visual example will suffice. And, in practice, tools exist\n",
    "that calculate the metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A “knot” exists whenever one control flow path\n",
    "crosses over another. In this example I wrote a little\n",
    "Fortran code because it’s really easy to write\n",
    "unstructured code with that language. I traced the\n",
    "control flow paths with arrows, and wherever one\n",
    "control flow path crosses over another I drew in a\n",
    "little red circle corresponding to a knot. This code has\n",
    "four knots so it is not structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured code also impacts testability,\n",
    "maintainability, understandability, and reliability. The\n",
