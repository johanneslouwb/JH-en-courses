    "\n",
    "In Activity based estimation, we'll now focus on **task sequencing** (TS). TS must be done before project schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "In task sequencing, we identify the dependencies between project tasks. Some tasks may be done in parallel (no dependency between tasks) and other tasks need to be done in order (dependencies between tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an input/output model for the task sequencing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary inputs are a list of the defined tasks, and any assumptions and constraints. Assumptions might be some of the same assumptions that went into the task definition process. An example of constraints might be that certain tasks have mandatory due dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools and techniques involved in the task sequencing process are primarily the identification of task dependencies and the construction of what is called a project network diagram. Task identification and construction of a project network diagram are very mportant because they help form the foundation for estimating a project’s schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks have different dependencies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks will have what’s called **mandatory dependencies** (dependencies that are inherent in the nature of the work that needs to be performed). For example, design before coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks may have **discretionary dependencies** (defined by the project manager or whoever is responsible for planning the project parts). For example, manager, may decide to break programming task into sub-tasks and have each subtask assigned to separate programmers so that they can be worked on in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of dependency is an **external dependency** (arise due to activities that have to be completed, but are outside of the direct sphere of influence of the project manager). For example, pieces of a project may be contracted out to external suppliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Illustrating dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Project network diagramming involves building a graphical model of the task dependencies. Many project management tools have features that enable building this diagram, and there are different notational formats that might be used. One type of project network diagram is called a **PERT chart**. A **Gantt chart** is another common tool for illustrating task dependencies…but the dependencies can be harder to see, depending upon how the Gantt chart is constructed and how much detail is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs to the task sequencing process include the project network diagram and possibly an updated task list. As an example, a previously defined task may have been divided into sub-tasks during the task sequencing process.\n",

    "## Schedule Estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schedule estimation involves taking the task dependencies, effort estimates, project constraints, and resource assignments and estimating the calendar completion dates for key project tasks and the overall project completion date.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different things that influence a project's schedule (whether it be making it shorter or longer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Effort**: More effort, often but not always translates into a longer schedule.\n",
    "- **Task dependencies** influence project schedule in a very significant way.\n",
    "- **Resources available**: Limited resources means not being able to break tasks into smaller ones to be worked in parallel - meaning staff will need more time\n",
    "- **Project deadlines**: When we have project deadlines that can’t be changed, we often need to work backwards from those deadlines when calculating the schedule, and sometimes find that deadlines can’t be met for a given scope of work or a fixed pool of available resources.\n",
    "- **Interruptions**: people get interrupted and also sometimes multi-task. When you multi-task, there is a 'ramp-up' time associated that you need to re-orient yourself each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to note is that **calendar days** is NOT the same as **person days**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input/Ouput and Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/08.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the **input** side, we have a \n",
    "- project network diagram, \n",
    "- effort estimates for at least the major work tasks, \n",
    "- a list of available resources namely people or job categories that will be assigned to the project. Important to note that one person might not be as productive as another (not all are equal).\n",
    "- a set of assumptions and constraints. Having a clear understanding of any assumptions that are being made and documenting those assumptions is crucial to arriving at a realistic schedule estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the **output** side is \n",
    "- a project schedule estimate, which would typically contain an estimate of the project completion date, and usually estimated completion dates for key project tasks and milestones. \n",
    "- In addition, supporting detail that documents any assumptions and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the **tools and techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "One can often use software (like microsoft project) - or even an excel spreadsheet. Something more complex like MS project is good because it takes into account many things and can help you do complex scheduling requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PERT vs. CPM:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMs can use **PERT** (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), and **CPM** (Critical Path Method). \n",
    "- **PERT** \n",
    "    - good to help account for project risks and even develop probabilistic schedule estimates.\n",
    "    - useful when estimating task effort or duration is difficult like in software projects or never-done-before projects. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **CPM** \n",
    "    - useful when effort or duration can be accurately estimated, but task dependencies are critical like in complex manufacturing or chemical production processes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### How many days will it take?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod032/09.png\" width=400>\n",
    "    \n",
    "We can compute the amount of time a project will take by looking at all the possible paths, then using the LONGEST path. This is called the **critical path**. A project can have more than one **critical path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical path is the sum of the longest path - and this is the time we use for project completion time. In our above example, the project completion time is **7 days**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taks ON the critical path cannot have any **slippage** (said to have **0-slack or float**). Meaning, if a task ON the critical path takes longer, the whole project takes longer. However, a task that is NOT on the critical path taking longer doesn't mean that the whole project will take longer (to a degree) - these are said to have slack or float. \n",
