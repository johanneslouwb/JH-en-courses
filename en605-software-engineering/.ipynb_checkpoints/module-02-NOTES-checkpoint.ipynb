    "# Software Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Software process, also called **software lifecycle** is a set of related activities that result in the production of a software product. Every software project goes through this and sometimes it is well defined and sometimes it is rather chaotic. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different kinds of cycles. For example, in some processes, the progression of tasks might be linear in nature: starting with a planning effort, then a determination of requirements, then development of design, then development of code etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/01.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some lifecycles may rather be an interative approach where each step is performed multiple times. Sometimes some lifecycles can be a hybrid of linear and iterative where there's linear steps and then iterative steps on some aspect of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/02.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use a lifecycle model? \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a very important tool for planning and managing a software project. When used correctly, it provides a framework or foundation for conducting all the activities associated with a project. For example establishing a standard set of project terminology, activities, and project deliverables and specifies the basic order in which the project activities will take place and the project artifacts will be delivered. This is very important from management, project team, and stakeholder standpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "A life cycle can also increase the visibility of project progress to all project stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project life cycle should serve as the foundation for project planning, estimating, and scheduling though, unfortunately, it sometimes isn’t used that way. And it should provide a mechanism for project tracking and control though, again, it sometimes isn’t used that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Impacts of choosing an appropriate model:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the decisions that needs to be made early on in a project is what type of life cycle model to use. Some\n",
    "organizations leave it up to the project manager to define the project life cycle that is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some organizations have a single life cycle model that’s used for all projects. In general, that may not be such a good idea unless the life cycle is appropriate for the majority of the organization’s project portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, some organizations have multiple life cycle models that are chosen based upon how best they fit the characteristics of a particular project. This has many potential benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a life cycle that is appropriate for the specific project at hand has a number of **potentially positive impacts** such as \n",
    "- increased development speed, \n",
    "- better product quality, \n",
    "- improved project tracking and control, \n",
    "- improved client relations, \n",
    "- decreased project risk, and \n",
    "- decreased project overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, choosing a life cycle that is not appropriate for the project at hand can significantly mitigate these benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code and Fix Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest life cycle model is often called the code and fix model. It’s a model that is very common, but seldom useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, you start with a general idea of the product to be built. That general idea can be informal and unwritten, or maybe consist of an informal list of things that stakeholders think might be necessary. Then, the development team progresses through a series of informal activities usually dominated by coding and fixing until the team has a product they think can be released. Successes are usually characterized by luck and heroic efforts, and are difficult or impossible to repeat on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to be fair this model does have some advantages. It’s very simple, so there’s no overhead involved in planning, documenting, and usually performing quality assurance activities. And since you typically jump right into coding there’s a perception that you’re showing very quick progress though this perception is often misleading. For very small projects maybe one-time uses, proofs of concept, or throw-away prototypes the code and fix model might be okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more typical projects, however, this model can be dangerous. It doesn’t yield the benefits that were just presented and is best avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/05.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Life Cycle Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "For our discussion purposes in this course module, I’ve grouped some commonly used project life cycle models\n",
    "into a couple of different categories \n",
    "- **sequential models**: in which the project activities are performed in an essentially linear sequence...culminating in delivery of a product at the end of the process;\n",
    "- **prototyping models** which incorporate the use of one or more product prototypes; \n",
    "- **staged delivery models** which deliver a product in stages rather than all at once; and \n",
    "- **iterative/incremental models** which incorporate performing development activities iteratively, building the product in discrete increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/06.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these models can yield the benefits I listed earlier if they are applied to the appropriate projects and executed correctly.\n",
    "In the forthcoming lectures, I’ll talk about specific examples of life cycle models in each of these categories as well as some hybrid models.\n",

    "# Sequential Software Life Cycles:\n",
    "\n",
    "The grandfather of sequential project life cycles is the **pure waterfall model**. There are numerous variations on\n",
    "this model, but I’ll introduce this one that will serve as the basis for all the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pure waterfall model, activities are performed essentially in sequence over time starting with problem definition and planning and culminating with the delivery of a software product at the end of the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically one or more project artifacts produced at each life cycle phase. For example, a requirements document is typically produced at the end of the requirements phase, one or more design documents are typically produced during the design phase, test documentation such as a test plan and test procedures are produced during the testing phase, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many projects will also hold reviews at the end of each phase to determine whether it is ready to move to the next phase. If it’s ready to advance it does. If it’s not ready to advance, then some or all of the activities of that phase are repeated until the project is ready to advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "At least that’s the way it is supposed to work. In practice, many projects continue to the next phase even though there are issues that have not been resolved with the current phase artifact which ultimately increases the required rework and can increase the project cost and schedule because the project team must repeat the activities in multiple phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the waterfall model gets its name from two things. First, from the sequential nature of the project activities. The requirements are all done, then the design is all done, etc. And, second, from the project momentum that builds as the project progresses from one phase to another. The further downstream a project is the more difficult and expensive it is to revisit earlier phases to make changes and corrections kind of like salmon trying to swim upstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modified Waterfall Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified waterfall model is just like the pure waterfall model, but there is a focus on providing and\n",
    "enforcing project checkpoints at every phase in the project with the understanding that issues uncovered at any checkpoint may require repeating the work activities of more than just the current project phase. For example, issues uncovered in preliminary design may require not only re-doing some of the preliminary design activities, but perhaps going back and repeating some of the activities in the requirements phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/08.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this is to try and mitigate some of the momentum problems of the pure waterfall model and make it easier to perform corrections and changes earlier and more frequently in an effort to reduce the overall cost of rework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Life Cycle Model Scorecard:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a kind of scorecard that rates the pure waterfall and modified waterfall models based on ten life cycle model capability criteria with relative scores ranging from poor to excellent:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/09.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The pure waterfall model can be used on projects of all sizes and complexities. It works well when customers know what they want and will make commitments. It also works well when estimates are updated and commitments are renewed one or more times in every project phase. Since this is often not the case in practice, adopting a modified waterfall in which more frequent changes can be accommodated can be more beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other disadvantages of the waterfall style life cycles are that the requirements must be fully-specified up front, project momentum (in the pure waterfall) can make repeating phases difficult, project visibility and control may be poor without careful selection of project milestones, and the product is not delivered until the end which can significantly limit stakeholder vision of what the final product will look like.\n",

    "# Staged Delivery Life Cycle Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture, we discussed waterfall-style life cycle models. The key distinguishing characteristic of waterfall models is that the product is not delivered until the end of the life cycle process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, with a staged delivery life cycle model the product is delivered in stages sometimes called increments. It starts out like the waterfall model in that the product is defined, the requirements are specified, and an overall architectural design is created. But from that point onward the functionality of the product is delivered in stages. Each stage delivers a subset of overall product functionality, and within each stage detailed design, coding, testing, and delivery is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/10.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of staged delivery is that provides some useful functionality to the customer earlier than in a waterfall approach. If properly planned, the project may also be able to deliver the most important functionality earlier and if the project runs into schedule or budget obstacles at least the customer has a product with the most useful features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staged delivery also provides more tangible measures of progress earlier in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenges to the staged delivery approach are that the project must have very careful planning and ongoing management, and successive deliveries must be designed so that there are minimal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Design to Schedule Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The design-to-schedule life cycle model is a variation on the staged delivery model. It is similar in that the\n",
    "definition, requirements, and architectural phases are completed, and the product is planned to be delivered in stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/11.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, the product features are typically prioritized based on some measure of importance, with the most important features being implemented first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between this model and the staged model, however, is that in this model we don’t know how many releases will actually be delivered because there is a real, unmovable deadline for product delivery. We might have four releases planned, but only three may be actually delivered because of the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model requires the same careful planning and management attention as the staged delivery model, and also requires that the product features be prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary disadvantage of this model is that if we don’t finish all the releases by the deadline then some of the effort spent in the definition, requirements, and architectural design phases will have been wasted and that time might have been able to be spent on implementing a few more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a scorecard for the staged delivery and design-to- schedule life cycle models. As you can see, neither of\n",
    "these models work well with poorly understood requirements, and they don’t adapt well for mid-course changes, but customer and management visibility is better than with waterfall-style models. And..these processes do require more management attention and sophistication compared to waterfall models.\n",

    "# Prototyping Life Cycle Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of life cycle model is a rapid prototyping model and there are several variations. In the model\n",
    "illustrated here, which I developed for one of my clients, rapid prototyping is really just incorporated as a tool into a pure waterfall or modified waterfall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/13.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, what’s a rapid prototype? A rapid prototype is a model of a piece of a software product, or the entire software product, that has limited functionality and that can be produced rapidly in hours or days. The prototype is working software and can have some user interactivity built into it. A prototype may address the user interface, provide simulated navigation, report mockups, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model I developed for my client, prototyping could be used in the concept definition phase, the requirements phase, the design phase, or the coding phase. In practice, it was used mostly in the concept definition and requirements phases, at least for this particular client. The whole idea behind a rapid prototype is to provide working software that simulates or approximates some aspect of the product to be built. For example, user menus and navigations, in executable form can give product users a very clear vision of what the user input will look like and can also help to define needed functionality. These software components would then be developed with tools that were different from the tool used to build the prototype and the prototype would serve as the specification of what needed to be built. The prototype software is basically thrown away. Rapid prototyping is often useful when users can’t visualize product capabilities from static models like traditional requirements or report mock-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prototyping almost always involves iterating. What distinguishes it from other iterative style processes is that we have rapidly constructed prototypes that are executable software and that only isolated pieces of a product are iterated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evolutionary Prototyping Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variation on the earlier rapid prototyping model is the evolutionary prototyping model. In this process, you\n",
    "typically start with some general notion of what the product is supposed to do. You then rapidly build portions of the product, usually starting with the user interfaces and product outputs, and then iteratively evolve the product to have more functionality until it completely meets the customer’s needs. In this model, the prototypes are not thrown away, but are evolved into the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/14.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model can be useful when requirements are changing rapidly, the customer is reluctant to commit to a set of traditional requirements, or the application area is not well understood either by the customer or the developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this model is that it’s difficult to predict how many prototype iterations will be required, and it requires disciplined management so that the process doesn’t degrade into a code and fix model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spiral Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of both an iterative life cycle model and a prototype life cycle model is the spiral model. I\n",
    "could have also put this model in my lecture on iterative/incremental models, but I decided to put it here. It’s a hybrid and could easily fit into either category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spiral model is a risk-driven model and it uses prototypes and iteration to mitigate project risks. Each iteration is often managed as a separate mini-project. Each iteration identifies one or more major project risks and the iterations continue until all the major risks have been addressed, at which point the final iteration may employ a waterfall-style life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each iteration, six basic steps are executed: \n",
    "- Determine objectives, \n",
    "- alternatives, and constraints; \n",
    "- Identify and resolve risks; \n",
    "- evaluate alternatives; develop the project deliverables for that iteration and verify that they are correct; \n",
    "- plan the next iteration; \n",
    "- and commit to an approach for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the basic idea...mapped to the diagram. You start on a small scale in the middle of the diagram, and explore the risks. You then make a plan to handle the risks, and follow the afore-mentioned steps. Any deliverable software is typically considered to be a partial prototype...not necessarily a rapid prototype. Each iteration moves the project to a larger scale. Early iterations are normally cheaper than later iterations. For example, developing a concept of operations is cheaper than developing requirements, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this diagram is meant to illustrate the concept and shouldn’t be taken literally. For example, it’s not necessary that you have exactly four loops in the spiral, and it’s not necessary that you perform the six steps in exactly the order I presented them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary disadvantage of the spiral model is that it’s complicated and requires careful management attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a scorecard for the prototyping and spiral life cycle models. The two prototyping models I discussed are lumped into one, since they have pretty much the same scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, both the prototyping and spiral models are useful when the requirements are not well- understood, and give the customer good visibility into project progress...but they do not work well for projects that have pre-defined schedule constraints, and they require quite a bit of management and developer sophistication.\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod02/17.png\" width=500>\n",

    "Iterative and incremental sometimes mean different things to different people, so it’s worthwhile defining them. Iterative means that life cycle phases like requirements, design, and so forth are repeated multiple times. Incremental means that each release contains additional functionality like in the staged delivery life cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple schematic of an iterative/incremental life cycle I developed for a bank client. In this model, the planning phase contains a high-level requirements definition activity. The requirements are then bundled into delivery cycles or increments. During each increment, several iterations of detailed requirements analysis, design, code, and test steps are performed and then integrated into a delivered product. Each increment adds new or refined functionality. Within each increment, each iteration implements a subset of requirements through the test phase, and each iteration adds new functionality and/or refines existing functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unified Process Life Cycle Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another example of an iterative/incremental life cycle. It’s IBM’s Unified Process model. This is a very\n",
    "complex model that provides more of a framework rather than a template for work activities. As can be seen from the diagram, this model provides for overlapping activities. For example, analysis and design for some functionality can be going on at the same time as implementation and test for other functionality...and each delivered set of functionality has most likely gone through several iterations.\n",

    "Here’s a scorecard for the iterative/incremental life cycle models. The two models I discussed are lumped into\n",

They are also very scalable, and can be used for both small and large projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be evident from our discussions in this course module that there is no best “one size fits all” life cycle model.

    "## Distinguishing Scrum from Kanban\n",
    "\n",
    "There are distinguishing characteristics for each agile method.\n",
    "- Scrum for example has utility for cross functional teams (or teams with multiple capabilities), while Kanban doesn’t need them.\n",
    "- Kanban uses a Kanban board, while scrum can utilize a graphical board it merely shows the tasks being worked in a given sprint.\n",
    "- Scrum tasks are time boxed (because sprints have a specific duration) while Kanban limits only number of simultaneous tasks being worked.\n",
    "- Since Scrum time-boxes tasks, it can use metrics such as the # of tasks attempted/implemented per sprint (known as velocity). In Kanban that metric is not used since there are no sprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements for Successful Agile Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Success in agile can be influenced by multiple factors.\n",
    "- The availability of team members fluent in a particular agile method can often constrain the desire to attempt it.\n",
    "- Developing agile experience can take significant time and investment, and this often presents a cultural challenge\n",

    "This decision will determine and manage the expectations of the stakeholders and greatly influence the outcome of the project.\n",
