    "# 8B: Object-Oriented Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we review the basic principles of object orientation. They are the basis for object oriented programming (in languages such as C++ or C# or Java, for example). They are also the basis for object-oriented analysis and design.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be obvious that it makes sense to use object oriented analysis and design if you are going to be programming in an object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the principles that we will be reviewing:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/01.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "**An object** is a thing. In other words it represents something that we care about; that we want to model. We want to create software to simulate these things that we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/02.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing that we are simulating can be something tangible, such as an airplane or pilot, **or** something intangible, such as an event like a takeoff or landing of an airplane. Everything we want to simulate has some data that needs to be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In analysis**, these things are found in the problem space. We try to model the things in the problem to be solved. In this sense, analysis is a discovery process. The problem is naturally made up of objects. It is our job as analysts to look for them and model them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In design and code**, objects are collections of data. Of course, the information encapsulated inside an object is used to simulate the object from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from your programming, objects have **two main properties**. \n",
    "- **Data** (state, attributes, fields, member data, and slots) and \n",
    "- **behavior** (operations, methods, member functions, procedures, and services).\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to keep in mind is that the **operations encapsulate the data**. That is, the only way to access the information stored in an object from outside the object is to invoke its operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to invoke an operation is to send a message to the object. A message is a request for service. An object will not perform any of its operations unless it receives a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object may perform the operation entirely by itself, using only its own data, or it may invoke the operations of other objects by sending messages to them in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "A message has a name, parameters, and a result. The name, parameter types and result type are called the ***signature*** of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of operation signatures for an object is called its ***protocol***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is a form of abstraction. It means that we treat a group of objects in the same way. So we may have a bunch of books. Each book as an author and an isbn number. If we were modeling books in a library or a bookstore, we would want to be able to treat all books in the same way. We wouldn’t want to have to model each book separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a template for object instances. All of the objects described by a class behave in the same way, and encapsulate the same kind of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be any number of object instances described by a class. One thing about a class in object-oriented systems is that a class has the ability to create or construct object instances. Some of the information stored in a class is descriptive information that is used when the class creates object instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you program in an object-oriented language, you create classes. The object instances don’t get created until run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in object-oriented analysis and object-oriented design is to model classes, not object instances. That is, we are mainly interested in the kinds of objects we are dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now some of the weird stuff. A class is really a kind of object. It encapsulates data, as we just mentioned. It also has operations (such as constructors). Something that has data and operations is called an object. Classes and object instances are stored differently in memory during the execution of a program. Classes are loaded into static memory. That is, since there is only one copy of each class, there is no need for the operating system to dynamically manage the storage allocated to the classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object instances are created by sending constructor messages to the classes. Since object instances can be created and destroyed, they have to be stored in memory that is managed dynamically. There are various schemes for handling this dynamic memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "As in any classification scheme, there are often similarities among classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These similarities may be represented in the form of **generalization-specialization** relationships among the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalization class is sometimes referred to as the **superclass** and the specialization as the **subclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically try to use the terminology generalization and specialization in analysis. Since superclass and subclass are programing language specific concepts, we normally will use these terms in design and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/03.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Unified Modeling Language, generalization specialization relationships are indicated by a line with a big fat arrow head pointing from the specialization class to the generalization class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see part of a class diagram for a book store. We sell three types of books: e- books, regular paper books, and audio books. They are all books, however. One thing that all books have in common is that they have a title. Specializations have properties of their own. For example, only e- books have digital rights management information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalization class defines a protocol that all of the specialization classes inherit. The specialization classes may add new attributes or operations. The specialization classes may override operations by having operations with the same signatures as in the generalization but with different behavior implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the operations in a generalization class may be abstract. Only the signature is specified, but no implementation. All of the specialization classes must override these abstract operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "In an object oriented system, variables may contain references to object instances. The type of the variable is specified by a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the type of the variable is a generalization class, that variable may contain a reference to an instance of that class or any of its specializations, or, in fact, any descendent class in the inheritance hierarchy stemming from the generalization class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here’s the important point: The protocol for sending messages to the object instance that the variable is pointing to is given by the type of the variable, not by the class of the object instance it is pointing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see part of a class hierarchy for vehicles. If we have a variable of type vehicle, it should be able to contain a reference to an object instance of an automobile, or an airplane, or a yacht. We should be able to send the message turnRight to the object without knowing which kind of object we are dealing with, since they all have steering wheels. However, suppose the variable is pointing to an airplane. We can’t send the message changeAltitude to that object because the type of the variable is Vehicle, and there is no changeAltitude operation defined for class Vehicle.\n",

    "# 8C: Finding Candidate Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting our treatment of object oriented analysis; The first step of OOA is to find some candidate classes. Analysis is a discovery process. It is our job as analysts to discover what important classes of objects exist in our software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "These candidate classes are the ones we will use to model the system during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are called candidate classes because they are our best guess at this point in the process as to the classes that we will need to eventually use to implement the system. It is early in the process, and so if we identify something as a candidate class, it may turn out to not be needed in the design. Alternatively, we may miss some class that will be needed down the line. We can always change our minds later. Things are pretty flexible at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create class diagrams that model the static relationships between the classes. We will then model the dynamic interactions between the classes using dynamic UML models such as activity diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to look for\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we find the candidate classes? Where do we look for them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The information that we have about the system at this point is the problem statement and the set of requirements. Believe it or not, these documents are rich in information about the classes of objects that we will need to eventually implement in the design and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that objects encapsulate data and provide operations. At analysis time, then, let’s look for what information and behaviors are mentioned in the problem statement and requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects have state\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that objects are repositories for information. We say that objects have state. The state of an object is reflected in the information that is hidden inside the object. This information changes from time to time, thus resulting in state changes in the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you hopefully recall from our discussion of state machines, the state of an object has an effect on what happens when a message is sent to an object. The same message may result in different behaviors when the object is in different states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model the objects as state machines without knowing how the data is implemented inside the object. That is, the object encapsulates, or hides, the data. We know it’s there, but we don’t need to know how it is stored. That is determined when we do design and coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object provides behaviors. We know what these behaviors are, and how they are specified, but we don’t need to know how they are implemented. That’s for design and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High cohesion & Loose Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another property we discussed earlier is that **objects have high cohesion**. An object is a collection of operations and data that are all related to a single purpose of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an unrelated piece of data or functionality to a class specification reduces its cohesiveness. Likewise, removing essential data or operations also reduces its cohesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects should be loosely coupled**. There should be well defined dependencies between the objects. We would normally like to minimize the number of other objects any object is dependent on. This keeps the complexity of the dependency graph to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anthropomorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you have noticed that we use terminology like objects “own” data and provide “services” to other objects. Objects communicate by sending messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we use rather anthropomorphic terminology when talking about objects. Anthropomorphism means treating things like people. Anthropo is Greek for person, morph means form. So anthropomorphism means giving human form to something. Usually the something is inanimate. We anthropomorphize lots of things. Like cars or boats or computers. We frequently talk about our software programs as though they were people. This seems quite natural. It is especially appropriate when talking about objects. Objects have state, just like people do. Objects request other objects to do things by sending them messages, just like people do.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see in a bit how we can take advantage of this anthropomorphism when we model the classes using what is called CRC analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Above all, it is imperative that we remember that we are modeling the problem in terms of **objects**, not data, and not just functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis is a Discovery Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to keep in mind is that analysis is a discovery process, not an invention process. Recall our discussion of the difference between discovery and invention. After we are done discovering and studying the classes, they should be understandable to all of the stakeholders. This means that there will not be any implementation classes in the analysis model. All of the classes should be reflected in the requirements or problem statement.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/06.png\" width=300>\n",

    "Almost everyone is familiar with on-line storefront systems. We log in, browse product listings, select products and add them to a virtual shopping cart, and then check out by providing payment information and shipping information. You can see here a simple use case model of such a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/07.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s focus on the use case for a customer to place an order. Since there is a use case for logging in, we will assume as a precondition here that the customer is logged in. The use case starts when the customer selects “create order.”\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/08.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the main success scenario. Each step that starts with the subject “System” is what we call a “system operation.” There are three kinds of things that can happen in a use case scenario: the actor sends a message to the system, the system sends a message to an actor, or the system does something internally. At the use case level of abstraction, this internal behavior is encapsulated. In analysis, it is our job to discover what is inside the system to make this work. Of course, what is inside the system is a collection of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/09.png\" width=300>\n",

    "# 8E: CRC Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will see how to use CRC analysis to investigate the properties of the candidate classes inside the system. CRC stands for **Class-Responsibility-Collaborator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique takes advantage of the aspect of objects that they can be anthropomorphized. This means that objects act like little people. They know things and they can do things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CRC analysis, the team members play the roles of objects in acting out scenarios. Of course, when we say scenario, we mean system operation. From the use case specifications, the system operations are elemental functions performed by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "They cannot be further decomposed. However, now that we have some idea of what objects are inside the system, and we have documented the system operations by listing the classes of objects involved in performing the system operation, we can role play the objects to figure out how they collaborate to carry out the system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good group dynamic technique because it allows the group to work together to solve the problem. Psychologists have found that groups almost always outperform individuals on creative tasks like this. Of course, it is also a synchronous activity, requiring all team members to be working together at the same time. It wouldn’t work so well in an asynchronous environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CRC Card\n",
    "\n",
    "The CRC approach was invented by Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham, and published in a paper contributed to a conference on object oriented systems in 1989. You may remember that Ward Cunningham is the inventor of the wiki collaboration tool. Kent Beck is the inventor of Extreme Programming, and is responsible for coining the term, Agile software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "They developed the technique while teaching a class in the object oriented programming language, Smalltalk. The class was having a hard time understanding the concept of objects, since they had never programed in an object oriented language before. Their main experience lay in functional programming languages such as Fortran or C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story goes that the class was being taught off-site in a hotel. They were discussing the case study that the class was to be working on in the lounge after class one day, and began sketching out the classes for the solution on cocktail napkins. They came up with the idea that the teams could role play the objects and capture the properties of the objects on the napkins. Of course, this ability for the objects to be role played is because of the anthropomorphic nature of objects. When they got to class the next day, they decided to use index cards rather than napkins because they were easier to write on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each card was labelled with the name of the class at the top. The bulk of the card was divided into two main areas, one for responsibilities and the other for collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/10.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two kinds of responsibilities:\n",
    "- It can remember things (it has attributes).\n",
    "- It can do things (it has operations).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are naming conventions for these responsibilities. The first word of the responsibility is either “Can” or “Knows”. We use “Can” if it is the ability to do something, and “Knows” if it is the responsibility to know something.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/11.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that objects sometimes can’t perform the entire behavior of being able to do something all on its own. It must request the services of other objects by sending them messages. They called this dependency a collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any responsibility to be able to do something that required the assistance of other objects, these other objects would be listed on the collaborator side of the CRC card.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/12.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what a CRC card might look like while role-playing a Product object in studying a storefront application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the collaborator, Tax, is listed opposite the responsibility, “Can compute tax.” This is an object that is needed to help out with this behavior. We need this because it would not be cohesive to include tax information inside a Product object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we hadn’t discovered the need for the Tax class during our initial discovery process, we can easily add it to the list at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod081/13.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "So here’s the CRC process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by picking a system operation to study. We have taken our best guess as to the objects that are involved in the system operation, either because we think they hold information needed for the system operation, or they can perform part of the function called for in the system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CRC card is created for each object involved in the scenario. Each team member takes ownership of one or more of the cards. It is up to that team member to play the role of that object when the scenario is being acted out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the triggering event. This is typically a message that is sent to the system from the primary actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the objects within the system will have to accept the responsibility to carry out the system operation. In some cases, if we’re not sure which object should have this responsibility; we may make up a separate “controller” object just for this purpose. We write the name of this responsibility on the left side of the CRC card of this object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we repeat the following until the system operation is complete: If an object has a “can” responsibility listed, and that object can’t completely perform the operation, it’s usually because it involves information managed by some other object or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team will determine which other objects are involved. The object doing the collaborating is called the client, and the objects providing the needed responsibilities are called servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team member playing the role of the client will write the names of the server objects on the collaborator side of the client CRC card. Usually, we keep the collaborator names even with the responsibility name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each collaborator, the team member playing the role of the client will negotiate with the team member playing the role of the server object to make up the name of the responsibility provided by the server object. The team member playing the role of the server object will write the name of this responsibility on the left side of the CRC card.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep doing this until all collaborations have been negotiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t get bogged down in discussions of how the objects communicate. We won’t worry about this until we get to Object Oriented Design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don’t attempt to be dogmatic about the CRC cards. Take your best guesses about responsibilities and collaborations, but don’t agonize over these decisions. They are just a first cut. You’ll get a chance to refine your decisions later when you do static and dynamic OOA modeling. For now, we’re just trying to get a general sense of the properties\n",
    "of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the first C in the name of the approach stands for Class, we have found it makes more sense to think of the cards as object instances of the classes. In some scenarios, you might find that you will need two or more instances of a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just use multiple cards. They can all be role played by the same team member or by different people. Your choice. The process works better if the entire team is in the same room, sitting around a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good medium to use is those 4x6 index cards. They give you enough room to write a lot. Of course, if you run out of room, you can certainly use multiple cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process works less well if the team members are distributed, and the cards are shared electronically. It doesn’t work at all if the team members are participating asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to do this for all of the system operations, but choose a representative sample that will allow you to study all of the candidate classes of objects.\n",
