    "# Software Engineering Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **software** first appeared in a publication by John Tukey in 1958. The term soft is used in the sense that it can be more easily modified that **hard**ware. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is software?\n",
    "\n",
    "We ususally think of software as a program and a program is a set of **instructions** stored in a computer's memory that can be executed by the computers hardware to perform some task. We can also include **documentation** in our definition as a program requires documentation for people to use it. We can also include **data** in our definition - a program needs data as input / output. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main categories of software **(1): application software** - performs a task for an end-user. **(2): system software** - general purpose (like OS, compilers etc) \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Engineering? \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **craft**: performed by a craftsman to produce real products for real people. These artisans or craftsman may aquire skills through an apprenticeship and there is no scientific background or formal training required. (weaving, painting, cooking, plumbing etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of pure **science** is to aquire knowledge - the discovery of facts and truths about the universe. It uses the *application of the scientific method* (running tests to prove / disprove hypothesis) it is based on scientific principles and requires a lot of academic formal training. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Engineering** shares some attributes of both science and craft. Like crafts, the goal of engineering is to produce real products for real people. And like science, it is based on real scientific principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of engineering is that engineers follow well defined repeatable processes\n",
    "\n",

    "So with software engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that it has an underlying science basis (computer science). We apply the principles learned in academic setting from a scientific context to produce something real and tangible - which is the engineering part of software engineering. **Software engineering is NOT the same as programming** - programming is only one *small part* of the SWE process. \n",

    "# The origins: \n",
    "\n",
    "The person generally credited with defining the term \"software engineering\" is **Margaret Hamilton** who was working at NASA and said that code/programming needs to be more than just that - it needed an engineering approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1968 there was an international conference sponsored by NATO for formalizing the definition of SWE and later on we will see the results of this conference. The reason why NATO (a military alliance) was the first to do this is because in those days, they (the military / space program) were the main consumers of software and hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **SOFTWARE ENGINEERING**: *The establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.* NATO SWE Conference 1969.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition highlights several of the issues that software developers were having at the time. You can see that they knew they needed to apply well defined, repeatable processes and procedures. Building software economically was important. Reliability means that the software does what it is supposed to do. Efficiency has always been an important property of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The timing of the conference, at the end of the decade of the 1960s is a reflection of the fact that the size and complexity of software systems were beginning to get out of hand. The traditional approaches to building software were not sufficient. An engineering process is what was needed. At the beginning of the decade, computers were not large or powerful enough to allow very big programs, so many of the problems with software didn’t become apparent until later, when larger computers allow us to build larger programs that began to exceed our intellectual control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The software crisis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Late and over budget\n",
    "- Poor quality\n",
    "- Code was hard to maintain\n",
    "- Customers and users were not happy\n",
    "- Projects were difficult to manage\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes software so hard? One word: ***complexity***. Good news: we got off to a good start in 1968 by beginning to think about software engineering. Bad news: the problem keeps getting worse. The complexity of our software systems is outpacing our ability to manage it. We have to keep coming up with better and better ways to handle the complexity problem. In fact, the term Software Crisis may not be the right term here. Some people have suggested that it would be better to call this the Software Chronic Affliction\n",

    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the relationship between software size (measured in Lines of Code (LOC)) and the complexity of the software. As the software size increases, the complexity increases exponentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Software is one of the most complex things invented by humans and the reason is because software is not a monolith - it can be made up of thousands or even millions of lines of code and each line of code affects all other lines of code (or could theoretically).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the complexity of a program is not really directly related to the number of lines of code - but instead to the number of interactions between lines of code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not every line of code will be connected to every other line of code, but the complexity of a program is some **fraction** of the **theoretical maximum** interactions between lines of code. What is this theoretical maximum? We can apply graph theory to help us with this. A graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Here the nodes are the circles and the edges are the lines. We can represent the lines of code as nodes and the dependencies between the lines of codes as edges between the nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/05.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theorem in graph theory that tells us that the number of edges between nodes is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{count} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moore's Law:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/06.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Gordon Moore was one of the founders of Intel, the chip maker. Moore postulated that the density of transistors per square inch was doubling roughly every two years. There are multiple corollaries to Moore’s law. One says that the cost of RAM decreases every couple of years. This has enabled computer designers to put more and more memory into computer as time went along. Anyone who has bought computers over the course of five or ten years can attest to this. Program size (in lines of code, LOC) is influenced by the amount of RAM memory in a computer. More RAM, more lines of code can be squeezed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line is this: as the typical size of programs in lines of code grows\n",
    "geometrically: $2^t$. The complexity of those programs grows exponentially: $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ or just n squared, which is much steeper growth curve. So, what are we to do about this increasing complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The study of computer science and software engineering go together here where they are both largely focused on reducing complexity - computer science at a granular algorithmic level, and software engineering at a larger systems level. "

    "# Goals and Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a definition for software engineering. We also know about the software crisis. It should be obvious that some of the main goals of software engineering would be to ameliorate the software crisis. There are some additional problems that software engineering can address. We will start by discussing these goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the early work in software engineering was devoted to figuring out ways to achieve these goals. Attacking the complexity issue was first among them. As we have seen, any engineering discipline follows a set of well-defined and repeatable processes and procedures. We will introduce some of the principles that underlie these software engineering processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of Software Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/08.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "**MODIFIABILITY**: The first is modifiability. As we discussed earlier, one of the main problems we had with the production of software was that there was never enough time to get things right. We were lucky to get something out the door on time. As we noted, one aspect of the software crisis was that what was delivered was not what the customer wanted or needed. However, when we tried to make changes to the software, we frequently made things worse. The software wasn’t designed to make it easy to change. A change to one part of the program would result in ripple effect problems in other parts. When we go to fix those defects, we would introduce more ripple effect defects. Things would just compound. Most of the time we would need to just rewrite the whole thing from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EFFICIENCY**: Efficiency has always been a problem with software and has thus been goal of software engineering. We always tend to want to push the envelope of the capabilities of the hardware in terms of both speed and memory usage. This has particularly been true in the early days of software engineering. It may be less of a concern today because the cost of memory and processing power are not as much of a gating factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RELIABILITY**: Reliability means can we rely on the software to do the right thing? How long will it run before it breaks? Reliability is measured in something called mean time to failure: how long will our software run properly and satisfy our needs until it breaks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**USABILITY**: And usability: can we use the software? Is it useful for us? And as a measure of this: is the customer satisfied with what they're getting? Is it something they need? Is it something they can use? Usability is related to human factors, and this is one of the main goals that they'd identified early on. This fits in with part of our definition of software engineering: real products for real people.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles of Software Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/09.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "**MODULARITY**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/10.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to control complexity is to reduce the number of things that need to be connected. So, we saw that the complexity of code was very high because of the interconnections between lines of code. Well, is there something we can do to reduce the number of things that need to be connected? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, instead of lines of code let's view the program as a collection of modules or components. There are well defined connections between the modules. Modules could be procedures, or functions, or classes, or packages for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to identify the modules would be to use the familiar divide and conquer approach to problem solving. If a problem is too big to solve, break it up into several smaller problems. If you can solve those, then you can combine their solutions in order to solve the original problem. If you can't solve one of the smaller problems, break it up into even smaller problems. Repeat this process until all the problems are solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some modularizations are better than others. A poor approach is random modularization, or sometimes called accidental modularization. As an analogy, consider printed circuit boards. Most electronic equipment today, such as computers or TVs, have a number of small modular circuit boards. Each one has its own purpose. In the old days, a piece of equipment, such as a TV, would typically have one large circuit board. Now, I could modularize this board with my table saw and cut it into six or eight smaller boards, but this wouldn't be considered good modularization. I would be slicing through connections. The individual boards wouldn't have their own functions and purpose the way we see in the equipment of today\n",

    "A simplified interface can be specified in terms of abstractions. An abstraction is a view of something that highlights the essential properties while at the same time suppresses unneeded details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we are familiar with the abstract interface for driving a car. We must know how to start it, accelerate and decelerate, turn, stop, operate the wipers and turn signals. Not much more than that. To the driver, that’s a car. \n",

What that means is that it “hangs together.” There is a principle of maximum cohesiveness. If a module is at its maximum state of cohesion this cohesiveness will be reduced in one of two ways: either adding something (data or behavior) that is not related to the purpose of the module, or by taking something (data or behavior) out of the module and putting it somewhere else. \n",

    "# Software Engineering as a Profession\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some things to think about when deciding whether something is a profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by just thinking of some professions. What do these professions have in common? What is a good indicator that something is a profession? Then, let’s apply these criteria to software engineering to see whether it is a profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/14.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, almost everyone would consider medical doctors or lawyers or engineers to be professionals. Because of their credentials, we can feel safe in putting our trust in their hands. They must pass rigorous tests to get a license to practice their professions. Same goes for teachers, plumbers and truck drivers. Though, first grade teachers need a lisence but not Hopkins professors? So by this definition alone, it a hopkins prof is not a profession? \n",
    "\n",
    "Most professions require that members have acquired a body of skill, either through trade school or apprenticeship. This skill is needed in order to pass the licensing exams. Most professions require their members to keep their skills current by taking continuing education classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is PGA Golfer in the list? One of the main differences between professional athletes (like baseball players, basketball players, and soccer players) is that professionals get paid and amateurs don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you play drums in a dance band and earned money doing it. It took some skill but there were no licensing requirements to do it. Given the criterion of getting paid, I called myself a professional musician. In fact, all I was was a paid amateur. Other musicians who were members of the musician's union were considered sort of professional, though\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed, these are some of the criteria that can be used to determine whether something is a profession.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also note that many professionals belong to one or more professional societies, frequently by invitation. Think FACS (Fellow of the American College of Surgeons) membership for doctors. Most of these professional societies have established codes of ethics by which members must abide\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, many aspects of software engineering seem like it is a profession. Software engineers must have a set of skills that must usually be obtained through academic training. These skills must be continually updated. (Not required, but necessary to keep up with a changing industry). Software engineers are not amateurs and do get paid\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/17.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently there are several efforts under way to create a professional software engineer exam and license. Doing a quick internet search of “professional software engineer” will lead to information on a lot of this effort. Many companies sponsor certification programs, usually on tools or processes sold by those companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes customers require that certain people working on a given contract have obtained certain certifications as a form of quality assurance. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, is software engineering a profession? I don’t think we can say that yet, but we are making progress in that direction\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod01/18.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two professional organizations that we software engineers can join. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the oldest professional organization for software people (despite its name, its principal focus is software).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other organization is a special interest society within the IEEE. The computer society is by far the largest society within the IEEE. \n",
    "\n",
    "To a large degree the two organizations overlap. Most professionals belong to both organizations. The dues are about a hundred dollars a year for each organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Students can join these societies at greatly reduced cost. Go to their websites for more information on student memberships.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing the two organizations did jointly was to develop a code of ethics and professional conduct. The ACM and IEEE versions are similar. Here is the link to the ACM version, which has been updated more recently. When you join one of these organizations, you are in effect agreeing to abide by the code of ethics and professional conduct. You should read this over before taking the quiz at the end of this module."
