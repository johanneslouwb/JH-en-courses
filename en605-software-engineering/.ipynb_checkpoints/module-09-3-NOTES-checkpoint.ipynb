    "#### Analysis Class Diagram\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/30.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what we have to work from. This is the analysis class diagram. We have to decide how to implement each of the three relationships. Two of them are associations, and one is an aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made a decision when we were doing the dynamic modeling to add an operation to the Product class to calculate the total price. We thought it would be better for Product to have this responsibility because of the principle that says keep the operation with the data. Also, if perhaps we wanted to give a quantity discount, the information that would support that behavior would be best kept in the Product object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Class Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/31.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the four classes we saw in the analysis\n",
    "class diagram.\n",
    "1. Let’s start with the Customer class, and add attributes and operations that we identified in our analysis modeling. Customer has a name\n",
    "2. There is an operation to check inventory\n",
    "3. There is an operation to add a line item.\n",
    "4. In the shopping cart, there is an attribute for storing the total price.\n",
    "5. We have the add line item operation in the shopping cart\n",
    "6. And the update total price operation.\n",
    "7. In the line item object, we will store the quantity.\n",
    "8. We also have the operation calculate total price in the line item.\n",
    "9. In the product object is where we decided to store the unit price\n",
    "10. We added the name attribute to the product class to help us with our instance diagrams\n",
    "11. There is the operation, compute price, in the product object\n",
    "12. Now let’s work on the associations.\n",
    "13. There is the “fills” association between Customer and Shopping Cart.\n",
    "14. The shopping cart is filled by only one customer\n",
    "15. The customer fills only one shopping cart at a time.\n",
    "16. Let’s store the references in the Customer object. We create an attribute called cart, which is a reference to an object instance of Shopping Cart.\n",
    "17. So the association becomes a directed association pointing from customer to shopping cart\n",
    "18. Now let’s look at the aggregation between ShoppingCart and LineItem.\n",
    "19. Each line item is part of only one shopping cart.\n",
    "20. A shopping cart can contain many line items.\n",
    "21. The place to store this linkage information is the shopping cart. Since the collection of references is unordered by default, we will use a set. Later on, if we decide that we need to keep the references in some sort of order, we can easily change this to a list.\n",
    "22. We indicate our decision by putting an arrow head on the end of the association line.\n",
    "23. For the association between line item and product\n",
    "24. We said that the product describes line items.\n",
    "25. Each line item is described by one product\n",
    "26. A product can describe many line items.\n",
    "27. We should store this linkage information in the line item object, so we add a referential attribute called prod to the line item class.\n",
    "28. To indicate this choice, we add an arrow head on the association line.\n",
    "29. The last decision we have to make is how to find a product object instance based on a key value. Let’s use the sku number of the product as its key. Sku stands for “stock keeping unit.”\n",
    "30. We need a lookup operation. Let’s call it getProduct. We pass in the sku value and it returns a reference to an instance of Product. This is a classifier scoped (or static) operation. We indicate this by using underlined font.\n",
    "31. To support this lookup operation, we need to store the lookup information in the class. The data model we will use is a map from sku number to product. Again, since this map is stored in the class, we use underlined font to indicate that this is a classifier scoped attribute.\n",

    "# 9L: Dynamic Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we will begin our investigation into dynamic modeling at the design level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Models the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/32.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in analysis, our main concern was to specify the classes inside the system and to understand how they collaborate to carry out the system operations. In design, our focus is on how this all happens in the code. The level of abstraction is higher than the code, so we won’t be bogged down in code level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the dynamics are concerned, we are interested in not only what the operations are, and in what order they are executed, but also how they get executed. We care about an object having a reference to another object when it needs to send a message to that object. So we will need to design the access to the object reference in addition to the use of the reference to send the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the UML Sequence Diagram notation to design these dynamics. This is a powerful notation that is more effective in modeling code level logic than activity diagrams are. The thing that made activity diagrams useful for analysis was that they weren’t at the level of coding. They enabled us to stay at the proper level of abstraction of analysis. But in design, we need a notation that is closer to the level of abstraction of code, and that’s the sequence diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that design is an abstract view of the code. Certainly there are a lot of decisions to be made about how the objects behave to carry out the system operations. Many times these decisions are left until coding time. In other words, many people skip over the design step and make what we could call design decisions when coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is that in code you have a lot of other things to worry about. The level of abstraction is too low to make intelligent decisions about what are really design issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous video, we modeled the static aspect of the object relationships. Things such as referential attribute placement are appropriate at the design level and shouldn’t be left to coding time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will be modeling the dynamics of the objects using the sequence diagram notation. As we get into this, you may begin to think that drawing sequence diagrams is more tedious than coding. There are two things I’ll say about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is that, sure the diagrams are harder to create than code. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Diagramming the dynamics forces you to think about the communication paths more clearly and you have a better chance of getting things right. Also, drawing sequence diagrams gets easier with practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more important thing about sequence diagrams is that they are drawn at a higher level of abstraction than code. In code you have to worry about a lot of low level things such as syntax, exception handling, and so forth. These kinds of details can be abstracted out in a sequence diagram. This allows you to concentrate on getting the messaging between the objects right.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make a mistake, it is much easier to go back and fix things in the sequence diagrams than it is trying to fix the code. Programmers have a great reluctance to change code once it’s written. In design we can easily make changes to our sequence diagrams. These same changes, if made at the coding level, would seem very huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we get things right in the design modeling, then it is relatively easy to write the code from the models that we have created. If all the hard decisions are made in the design, then coding should be easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Invoking the system operation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each system operation, we need to identify a controller. This controller may be one of the existing entity classes, or it may be a made up class, especially constructed for the purpose of controlling the system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose an existing entity class, it usually is one with the same name as the actor that initiates the system operation. For example, in our Internet storefront example, a customer actor sends a message to the system to add an item to an existing shopping cart. In our static modeling, we have identified a class called Customer. We could include an operation called “AddItem” in the Customer class to serve as the controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the controller is an operation, not an object or a class. Thus, if we choose the option of creating a special controller class, it probably would only have just that one operation, and no attributes. It would just be a holder for the controller operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have to concern ourselves with how this controller operation gets invoked. What happens when the customer actor invokes the addItem system operation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways the customer actor can communicate with the system. One is for the actor to send the actual customer object instance as a serialized object. This could be done with some kind of remote procedure call or remote method invocation mechanism. We would need a boundary class to handle communication to and from the actor. The boundary class would reconstitute the customer object and then execute the addItem operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "More frequently, the communication between the actor and the boundary object is done via text messages. There are a number of Internet protocols that enable this. HTTP is probably the most common protocol. The actor issues a Get request that is executed by the boundary class in the server. The Get operation will parse the text and pull out the command and the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the command would be addItem, and the parameters would include the unique identifier of the item and its quantity. We have used the stock-keeping unit, or SKU as the unique identifier of items in our catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, the server has received a message from the customer actor asking to add an item to an existing shopping cart. We have decided that the Customer object will be the controller for this system operation. How does the system know which instance of the Customer class owns the shopping cart that we want to add the item to? There are two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is that the boundary object receives the customer id from the actor and the specific instance of the Customer class must be located using a lookup operation, as we discussed earlier in static design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is that the system has saved the reference to the specific customer object instance in something called a session object. The session object is created when the customer first logs in. The session object has its own unique identifier. Every time the customer actor interacts with the system, it passes this unique session id to the system. The boundary class can use the customer object reference in the session to send messages directly to the correct customer object instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens next?\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now we have figured out how the addItem operation will be invoked. How do we model what happens next? In analysis, we used activity diagrams, which were good at showing the sequence in which the objects performed their operations, and what these operations are. The notation did not support any good way to show parameters being passed or results being returned when these operations were being invoked. Sequence diagrams are good at this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in order to send a message you must have the reference to the object you are sending it to, unless you are invoking a classifier scoped operation, which has global visibility. In analysis, we didn’t concern ourselves with how these references are obtained. In design, this is a major concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence diagrams are very useful for modeling these kinds of details as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Obtaining an Object Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/33.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways in which a reference to an object instance may be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference is stored as a referential attribute in an object, it may be used to send a message. Frequently the multiplicity of these referential attributes is greater than one. This means that there is a collection of referential attributes. You’ll need some kind of key to enable a search for the correct reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture, Alice knows Charlie’s phone number. She can call Charlie whenever she needs to. Sometimes the reference is returned to you as a result of a message you send to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "The message may be to an object instance that is able to provide the reference. Or maybe the reference is returned from the invocation of an object lookup operation, as we discussed earlier. In our example here, Alice asks Bob to do a job that involves calling Charlie. Bob doesn’t know Charlie’s number, but Alice does. Let’s assume Bob has caller ID and can call Alice back and ask for Charlie’s number. He can then call Charlie and complete the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to obtain a reference is to have it passed in as an argument when you are sent a message. Alice asks Bob to do the job. She knows he will need to talk to Charlie so she gives Bob Charlie’s number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth way to obtain the reference is if it is globally visible. One way this can be accomplished is to use the singleton design pattern. This is one of the patterns we will cover later in the course. In a nutshell, a singleton object or value can be stored as a static attribute of a class. The class will provide a static operation that will return the singleton reference or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose in our example, Charlie is really directory assistance. This service can be reached everywhere by dialing 411. It’s globally visible. You don’t need to look it up. Of course there are other ways for Bob to get a message to Charlie. Since Alice knows how to contact Charlie, Bob could ask Alice to forward a\n",
    "message to Charlie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mechanism to get a message to Charlie would be for Bob to post the message on the bulletin board. Charlie checks the board frequently, and receives the message from Bob eventually.\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/34.png\" width=400>\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/35.png\" width=400>\n",

    "Usually we show the operation signature on the\n",
    "line, including the formal parameter names and\n",

    "# 9O: Design Sequence Diagram for Storefront Example\n",

    "In this video we will review the sequence diagram\n",
    "for the addItem system operation in our Internet\n",
    "storefront example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/45.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to print out the sequence diagram\n",
    "as some of the text may be too small to read on\n",
    "the screen.\n",
    "This sequence diagram incorporates a number of\n",
    "the concepts we discussed earlier in this module.\n",
    "1. The sequence begins with the Customer actor sending a message to the system asking it to add an item to an existing shopping cart. It passes in the sku for the item desired, the quantity, and the session id. This message is received by the Customer boundary object. The boundary object controls things for a while.\n",
    "2. The first thing the boundary object needs to do is to find the session object instance corresponding to the session id that was passed in from the actor. It sends the lookup message (getSession static operation) to the Session class, passing in the session id and getting back the reference to the object instance of Session that contains the objects pertaining to the current customer.\n",
    "3. Then the boundary object sends a message to the session object to get the reference to the correct instance of the Customer class.\n",
    "4. Now that we have the reference to the customer object, we can send it the message addItem, passing in the sku and the quantity. From this point, the flow is quite similar to what we discussed earlier.\n",
    "5. The first thing the customer object will do is to find out if there is sufficient quantity of the product in stock. In our design, we are using a proxy object to help us communicate with the external Inventory subsystem. A proxy is an object that stands in for something else that may be otherwise quite complicated to communicate with. The message we send to the proxy is “isSufficientQuantity,” passing in the sku and quantity. The proxy talks to the actual inventory subsystem to determine whether there is enough stock to fulfill the order. It returns a Boolean result.\n",
    "6. If there is sufficient quantity, we execute the activity shown in the upper part of the “alt” frame. If not, we would execute the lower part of the frame.\n",
    "7. In the upper part of the frame, the first thing that we do is to obtain the reference to the object instance of Product, based on the sku. The lookup operation is a static operation in the Product class. We pass in the sku, and it returns a reference to the corresponding object instance of the Product class.\n",
    "8. We’ll use this product reference to construct a new instance of the LineItem class. We pass the Product object reference and the quantity to the constructor.\n",
    "9. The line item object is created. We see that the box representing this object instance appears at the point in the timeline when it is created. The constructor returns a reference to the line item object.\n",
    "10. Now we add the line item to the shopping cart. The customer object already has a link to the shopping cart object, since the cart was created in a previous system operation, and there was a precondition on the current system operation that the cart exists. So the customer object sends the message addLineItem to its shopping cart. It just passes in the reference to the line item object on this message.\n",
    "11. The shopping cart adds the reference to the line item to its list of line items, and returns.\n",
    "12. The next thing that happens is the pricing. The customer object asks the shopping cart to update its total price.\n",
    "13. The shopping cart will ask the line item to calculate its total price.\n",
    "14. As we discussed before, we are going to let the Product object compute the total price because we decided to put the information about unit price in the product, and so the job of multiplying the unit price by the quantity goes to the product object.\n",
    "15. The price information is returned to the line item, which returns it back up to the shopping cart. The cart adds that price to its total price, and then returns back to the customer object.\n",
    "16. The customer then returns control back to the customer boundary object, with a status of “ok.”\n",
    "17. In the else part of the frame, there is not sufficient quantity of the product in stock. The customer object returns control back to the customer boundary object with the status, “fail.”\n",
    "18. In either case, the boundary object returns back to the actor, forwarding the status it received from the customer object. And that completes the sequences of actions for the design of the system operation for adding a line item to an existing shopping cart.\n",
