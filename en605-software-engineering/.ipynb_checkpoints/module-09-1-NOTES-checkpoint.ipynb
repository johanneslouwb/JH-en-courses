    "# 9B: Dynamic Analysis Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic modeling means that we model things changing over time. There’s always an element of time in dynamic modeling. What can change over time? Information inside the system can change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs that the system sends to the external actors are events that occur over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have alternated between dynamic and static modeling at lower and lower levels of abstraction. \n",
    "That brings us to this point. Now we are ready to do dynamic modeling once again. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason we like to model the behavior of the system in terms of system operations is that they provide a convenient level of granularity for doing dynamic modeling. Trying to model an entire use case can be rather difficult. A use case is actually a collection of system operations. System operations are behaviors that are visible from outside the system. They describe what the system does as a step in a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system operation is invoked by an actor during a use case scenario. A system operation is an elementary unit of functionality that is performed by the system, as seen from the outside. It can’t be decomposed any further at the requirements level of abstraction. The next level of decomposition requires an understanding of what is inside the system to make it work. This is the level of abstraction that we are at during analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "A system operation typically results in a change in state of the system. We will specify a system operation in terms of the state of the system before and after the execution of the system operation. These changes can be documented as preconditions and postconditions. What we mean by system state is the values of all of the information stored within the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you recall, there are only two ways to store information inside a system of objects: attribute values within object instances and links connecting objects to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Before and After\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to change the state of the system is to invoke a system operation. The invocation of the system operation is called a “trigger.” The only kinds of system state changes that can occur are these five:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creation of an object instance\n",
    "* Destruction of an object instance\n",
    "* Creation of a link connecting two object instances together\n",
    "* Destruction of a link\n",
    "* Modification of attribute values within an object instance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, we see two snapshots of the objects: before and after a system operation. The system operation here is the one we have been using as an example: Add an item to a shopping cart. The black indicates the condition of things before the system operation executes, and the green shows the state of things afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the cart already includes one line item for two Acme parachutes before the system operation starts. Their unit price is \\\\$150, to the total price for the cart starts at \\\\$300. Now, in this system, operation, the customer will ask to add one Acme anvil. The trigger is “add item to order.” The inputs are the Product object for the anvil, and the quantity, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system communicates with the Inventory actor. Presumably, in this scenario, there’s at least one anvil in stock. A new object instance of the class LineItem is created, and its quantity attribute is set to 1. The LineItem object is linked to the already existing Product object for the anvil. The Product object knows that the unit price of the anvil is \\\\$200. The total price attribute of the ShoppingCart object is updated to \\\\$500.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do you get from here to there?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to model how the system gets from the before state to the after state (from the preconditions to the postconditions). As we see, there are several things that change between the before and after pictures. We can’t be sure about the exact order in which these changes occur, but we can produce models of possible ways things might happen.\n",

    "# 9C: UML Activity Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will see how we can use the UML Activity Diagram notation to document a flow of events inside the system to carry out the effect of a system operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last time we did dynamic modeling was when we were acting out scenarios for our CRC modeling. However, the only things we recorded were the responsibilities and collaborator dependencies. We didn’t capture the dynamics. Activity diagrams provide us with a notation for describing the dynamic collaborations of the objects graphically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity diagrams are **good at showing the sequence of actions that occur inside the system when a system operation is being executed**. The actions in the activity diagram correspond to the execution of operations on individual object instances inside the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What activity diagrams do not show is how the objects communicate. Who sends messages to whom? This is not a concern during analysis. It will be one of the things we will need to figure out when we get to design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions and Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/02.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In an activity diagram, we can see that object A executes one of its operations and then object B executes one of its operations. What we can’t say for sure is how control passes from object A to object B.\n",
    "\n",
    "An activity diagram is sort of like an old fashioned flow chart. The boxes are called actions and the directed lines connecting the boxes are called flows. (They are sometimes referred to as edges or transformations, but we will try to use the term flow here.) The arrow heads on the flows indicate the direction of flow of control. In a well- structured activity diagram there is exactly one flow into an action and one flow out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start and End Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two special nodes in an activity diagram. They are the start and end nodes. The start is represented as a solid circle with a flow coming out of it. The end, or activity final, node is a solid circle with a ring around it, and only one flow coming into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision and Merge Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in flowcharts, there are decision nodes in activity diagrams. The difference here is that a decision node has nothing inside it (just like start and end nodes have nothing inside them, either). A decision node has one incoming flow and multiple outgoing flows. Each of the outgoing flows is annotated with a Boolean expression, called a guard. Guards are enclosed within square brackets and are placed near the flows emanating from the decision node. At the point in the flow when the decision is reached, the guards are evaluated. The outgoing flow corresponding to the guard that is true is the path that is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally, then, a good idea for all of the guards to be disjoint – otherwise the flow will be nondeterministic, which is something you don’t want in a computer program. It is also a good idea for there to be no gaps in the set of guards. In logic, we would say that if all of the guards are OR’ed together, they should result in a Boolean TRUE. Violating this condition might result in a premature halt in the flow of control. If the decision point is reached and all of the guards are evaluated, and none of them resulted in a TRUE condition, the flow would stop right there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corresponding to a decision node is a merger node. The merge is also a diamond shaped node, also with nothing inside it. The purpose of the merge node is to merge all of the paths that were created at the decision node back together into a single flow once again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-structure activity diagram, all of the flows that come out of a decision are combined back together again in a merge. There are exceptions, but this is the basic rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fork and Join\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/05.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "A construct that is structurally quite similar to the decision and merger is the fork and join. We use the same icon for both the fork and the join. It is a straight bold line. The fork has a single flow coming in, and multiple flows coming out. The join has multiple flows coming in, and a single flow coming out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike with the decision-merge structure, where only one flow is executed, with the fork and join, all of the flows emanating from the fork are executed. They are preformed asynchronously. This means that they could be executed at the same time, or they could be executed in any order. It shouldn’t matter what order they are executed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the flows that come out of a fork are joined back together again at the join. The behavior of the join is that it won’t resume with the outgoing flow until all of the incoming flows have finished executing and control for each flow has arrived at the join.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a well-structured activity diagram, all of the flows that come out of a fork are combined back together again in a join. There are exceptions here also, but this is the basic rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitions\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/06.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of activity diagram modeling is the partition, or sometimes called the “swim lane.” While keeping all of the flows intact, it is possible to rearrange the actions so that they are in groups based on who performs them. The “who” in this case might be actors, or subsystems, or object instances. The partitions are labeled with a name indicating who performs the actions in the partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of this notation. It is an activity diagram for baking a cake. It starts when an object instance of Chef executes the “gather ingredients” action. Then the chef will mix the dry ingredients and mix the wet ingredients separately. These actions may be done in either order, or at the same time. They are asynchronous. After both actions have finished, flow continues with the chef combining the wet and dry ingredients. What happens next is a decision. If the altitude is less than 4000 feet, the path on the left is taken. If the altitude is greater than or equal to 4000 feet, the one on the right is taken. In either case, the oven will bake the cake for a certain amount of time at a certain temperature. The flows merge back together and then the guests allow the cake to cool and then enjoy eating it. The activity terminates at that point.\n",

    "#### System Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/09.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics we will show in the activity diagram are a bit more detailed than what we explored in the CRC analysis. We will find that we need to add a couple more operations to some of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the system operation specification. We’ve been through this before several times, so the behavior should be familiar to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activity Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/10.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the activity diagram. Notice that the partitions run horizontally. Sometimes things fit better on the page this way. In an activity diagram, the partitions can be either vertical or horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our activity starts with the customer actor requesting the operation “add item.” The customer actor communicates with the system through what is called a boundary object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two boundary objects in this diagram. One for the customer and one for the inventory subsystem. The boundary objects serve as intermediaries between the actors outside the system and the objects inside the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary object for the customer then invokes the operation “add item” in the object instance of the Customer class inside the system. Before we can process the item, we have to determine that there’s enough stock in inventory. This action is performed by the inventory boundary object, which communicates with the external inventory subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the inventory is OK, a line item object is created and its quantity is set. In design, this will be done by a constructor. For analysis we can simply invoke a setter operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the item is added to the shopping cart. We go back to the line item to perform the action, calculate total price (which is done by multiplying the unit price by the quantity). The unit price is in the Product object. The quantity is in the LineItem object. So which object will perform the action? We talked about this before. One approach would be for the line item to ask the product for the unit price and multiply it by its quantity. The other would be to pass the quantity to the product object and let the product compute the total price. We chose the second approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem like an arbitrary choice, but there is an important rule of object oriented software engineering at play here. That rule says to let the object that owns the data do the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule results in better encapsulation of the data. As we discussed, there is also another advantage of having the Product object do the calculation of the total price. Suppose there is a volume discount. Only the Product should know the rule for computing this discount. The unit price would be different depending on the quantity. This knowledge should be encapsulated inside the Product object. That’s why we let the Product perform the action of computing the price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the total price in the shopping cart is updated. And the activity ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, activity diagrams are good at showing the sequence of actions. They are good at showing looping, decision making, and asynchronous activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "But they aren’t so god at some other things. They don’t show arguments being passed and results being returned. They also don’t show who’s in control. Just because one action follows another doesn’t mean that the object performing the first action sends a message to the object performing the second action. There could be another object sending messages to both of the objects. Also, there is no way to show creation or destruction of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These things are mostly design level considerations, so they don’t really present a big problem for us at analysis time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we get to design, we will be using UML sequence diagram notation. This will handle most of the things we just said were difficult with activity diagrams.\n",

    "# 9E: Intro to OO Design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Change in Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "In design, our focus changes. When we were doing analysis, we were trying to get an understanding of what classes needed to be built and how the object instances of those classes interacted to carry out the system operations. In design, we are concerned about how those classes should be implemented in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another way of looking at this. The requirements models specify the system as a black box. The analysis models specify the classes within the system as smaller black boxes. Design, on the other hand, is an abstraction of the code. It models the implementation at a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is a more concrete view of the requirements while design is a more abstract view of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be talking about some techniques for mapping the analysis model to the design model. There were a few occasions when we were doing the analysis modeling that we said that we would defer certain decisions until design time. Well, now’s that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "During analysis we weren’t too concerned with control strategy. We were more interested in understanding the behavior of the objects themselves. In design, control is a big issue because it affects the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "At analysis time, we modeled relationships between the classes, but didn’t get too concerned about how those relationships would be implemented in code. Well, now we will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the design there will be a lot more classes than in the analysis. In analysis, we only modeled just the domain, or entity classes. In the design, we will see that we will need a lot of what I call “helper” classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Details\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/11.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that we will have to decide on is the control strategy. When one object sends a message to another, it must have a reference or pointer to that object. In analysis we weren’t concerned about this. In design, it is one of the things we’ll spend some time figuring out and modeling in UML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design is when we begin to be concerned about performance. There are side effects of design decisions. Performance can be used as a driver for making design decisions. In design, we need to worry about boundary conditions or software faults. We need to develop a strategy for handling situations when things go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin to be influenced by the programming language and the operating system at design time. Things like single vs. multiple inheritance, Java interfaces, garbage collection, etc. will pose constraints on our design\n",
