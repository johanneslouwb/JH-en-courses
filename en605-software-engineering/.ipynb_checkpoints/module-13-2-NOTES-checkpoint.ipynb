    "\n",
    "Let me start this lecture by introducing some of the\n",
    "basic test design strategies used in practice.\n",
    "The first strategy is called black box testing…and in this\n",
    "strategy tests are designed from the requirements. You\n",
    "saw an example of black box testing in the triangle\n",
    "exercise in an earlier lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### White box testing strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/34.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy for testing is commonly called white\n",
    "box testing or logic-based testing. In this approach the\n",
    "test designer uses the code as part of the test case\n",
    "design strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in practice, both approaches to testing must be\n",
    "used…the difference is which approach is best-suited to\n",
    "the various levels of testing and who is doing the\n",
    "testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Functional Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/35.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I discuss the different testing levels, I want to\n",
    "take a minute to compare some of the differences\n",
    "between traditional software design architecture and\n",
    "object-oriented design architecture…because the\n",
    "differences drive slightly different approaches to\n",
    "testing, at least at the lower levels of testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches to software design result in\n",
    "architectures that exhibit what we call functional\n",
    "decomposition. Components that perform higher levels\n",
    "of functionality…like calculating the total amount of a\n",
    "sale…are decomposed into simpler and simpler\n",
    "components that provide pieces of the higher level\n",
    "functionality, as this design diagram illustrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-hierarchical OO Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/36.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented designs are generally not functionally\n",
    "decomposed, though functional decomposition\n",
    "techniques can certainly be used in the design of\n",
    "complex methods for a class. Object-oriented designs\n",
    "tend to be driven by class responsibilities and\n",
    "collaborations rather than by functional\n",
    "decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters of objects collaborate to provide a product’s\n",
    "functionality…as illustrated in this diagram. Object-\n",
    "oriented designs are also comprised of layers that fulfill\n",
    "certain responsibilities. For example, a presentation\n",
    "layer would contain classes that are responsible for the\n",
    "user interface, an application or domain layer would\n",
    "contain classes like the ones in this diagram, a\n",
    "persistence layer would contain classes that are\n",
    "responsible for storing and retrieving the information\n",
    "stored in objects…and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/37.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest level of testing is called unit testing. A unit is\n",
    "the smallest element that can be separately compiled\n",
    "and tested. Depending on the implementation\n",
    "language a unit could be a subroutine or a function.\n",
    "In traditional…or functional oriented…software\n",
    "development, testing units independently typically\n",
    "requires the use of test drivers and test stubs if\n",
    "different software engineers are tasked with\n",
    "developing different units.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test driver serves as a main program that contains or\n",
    "accepts test case data that is fed to the unit under test.\n",
    "A stub is software that in some way simulates the\n",
    "behavior of units that are called by the unit under test.\n",
    "For example, if the unit under test called two other\n",
    "units, one way to test it would be to develop stubs for\n",
    "the called units that maybe just printed a message that\n",
    "they were called or printed any data that were passed\n",
    "to them from the unit under test. When the actual\n",
    "code for the called units is available, they are\n",
    "integrated into the configuration and tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "If units are scheduled to be developed bottom up…that\n",
    "is, from the bottom of the component hierarchy to the\n",
    "top, then the actual called units would be available and\n",
    "stubs may not be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Oriented Unit Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/38.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing in object-oriented development projects\n",
    "works a little differently. Since the individual methods\n",
    "belong to a class, some or all of the methods are\n",
    "developed and then individual methods of the class are\n",
    "tested one at a time. A test driver simply creates a class\n",
    "instance and invokes one or more of its methods. If a\n",
    "method calls another method in the same class, either\n",
    "a stub is used or the actual method is used. If a method\n",
    "calls a method in another class, a stub may be used if\n",
    "the other class is not yet developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Integration Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/39.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration testing involves testing product\n",
    "components that make up a particular hierarchy or\n",
    "collaborative relationship. In traditional integration\n",
    "testing there are various integration test strategies that\n",
    "are used in practice…such as top-down and bottom-up\n",
    "strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a traditional functionally\n",
    "decomposed design. In top-down integration testing,\n",
    "we would start with the top-most unit and use it as the\n",
    "basic test driver and control module.\n",
    "If we were to use a level-by-level, or breadth-first\n",
    "approach, we would integrate the first five components\n",
    "directly subordinate to the calculate total sale amount\n",
    "component, and use stubs for the get sale data and edit\n",
    "sale data components. We would then move down to\n",
    "the next level in the control hierarchy and integrate\n",
    "those two modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use a depth-first integration test\n",
    "approach, we would pick a control path, like the left-\n",
    "most one, and integrate it with the calculate total sale\n",
    "amount component, using stubs for the other first-level\n",
    "components. Then, we would integrate the first-level\n",
    "components one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bottom-up testing, we start at the bottom of the\n",
    "hierarchy and work our way up. We’d typically start\n",
    "with a subgroup of components that work together to provide a higher-order level of functionality. In this\n",
    "example, that would be the get sale data and edit sale\n",
    "data components. We’d then develop a test driver to\n",
    "harness and invoke those components. We’d then\n",
    "move up a level, replacing the driver with the actual get\n",
    "valid sale data component…and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another integration test strategy, sometimes called the\n",
    "“big bang” strategy, is to take all the components, build\n",
    "the entire architecture, and test everything at once.\n",
    "That might be okay for very small products, but is not\n",
    "recommended for large ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Oriented Integration Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/40.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented integration testing, there really isn’t\n",
    "a functional-decomposition hierarchy, so we typically\n",
    "look at class collaborations, dependencies, and\n",
    "architectural layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Class A is dependent upon Class B, and\n",
    "Class B is dependent upon C and D. So, one integration\n",
    "strategy that would work here is to first develop Class C\n",
    "and Class D, then integrate them into Class B, and then\n",
    "integrate B into A. Test drivers would be used to create\n",
    "and run the tests at each of these increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented design architecture is layered, so\n",
    "maybe these four classes constitute the application\n",
    "layer of the architecture. We may then use a test driver\n",
    "to simulate the user-interface layer during the\n",
    "integration increments and while the actual GUI\n",
    "components are still under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Levels and Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/41.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the level of test that is being done, the testing\n",
    "strategies will be different. At the unit level, both black box and\n",
    "white box tests are used. As we go into integration testing, tests\n",
    "generally become mostly black box in nature, and at the system\n",
    "and acceptance levels...where the software product is tested in its\n",
    "entirety...the tests should be all black box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/42.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of test responsibilities, developers typically perform the\n",
    "unit level and integration levels of test...though on very large scale\n",
    "products, an independent test team might be responsible for\n",
    "integrating major subsystem components. It‘s very common for an\n",
    "independent test team to perform the system level testing, and\n",
    "customers may be responsible for performing or at least\n",
    "participating in acceptance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of test objectives, for traditional testing the unit level is\n",
    "where it is important to exercise a high percentage of program\n",
    "logic, test low level functionality, and low level performance\n",
    "requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration testing usually focuses on higher level functionality,\n",
    "component interfaces, and higher-level component performance.\n",
    "And...at the system and acceptance levels the focus is on\n",
    "requirements completeness and correctness and overall fitness for\n",

    "\n",
    "### Object Oriented Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/43.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to object-oriented testing, the responsibilities are\n",
    "the same, and the objectives at the system and acceptance levels\n",
    "are the same...but there are additional types of testing that need\n",
    "to be done at the lowest levels, as indicated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of relationships that exist between\n",
    "classes in object-oriented software development, and those\n",
    "relationships require that more types of testing be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, object-oriented projects tend to be use case driven, so it is\n",
    "common for the use cases to serve as the basis for system and\n",

    "### Requirements based test design\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/44.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture I‘m going to discuss several black box techniques that\n",
    "can be used to design test cases based on the requirements for a\n",
    "software product...input space partitioning, boundary testing, and\n",
    "decision tables and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the nice things about these techniques is that they are\n",
    "systematic and repeatable...you can replicate how many tests you\n",
    "need, and demonstrate why a certain number of tests are needed,\n",
    "which can give you lots of credibility when someone asks how you\n",
    "came up with a certain number of tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "And...they can be used when requirements are written using a\n",
    "traditional approach as well as when use cases are used to\n",
    "document a product‘s functional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Functional Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/45.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take an example and see how these techniques can\n",
    "be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an insurance company application needed to\n",
    "calculate policy premium adjustments that are based on\n",
    "a person’s age and the number of claims filed in the past\n",
    "year. The textual description describes this requirement\n",
    "in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to start by mapping a requirement’s inputs\n",
    "and outputs to the functional requirements model that\n",
    "was introduced earlier in this course. That will be very\n",
    "helpful when we ultimately derive test case data, and it\n",
    "fits nicely into the techniques we’re going to discuss.\n",
    "So…let’s map the inputs and outputs for this\n",
    "requirement…calculate premium adjustment…into our\n",
    "functional requirement model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs in this case are two variables …an age and a\n",
    "number of claims. And these input variables could\n",
    "further be broken down into subcategories as indicated.\n",
    "Note that there is a general rule that specifies the\n",
    "minimum insurable age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output in this example would be one of four\n",
    "adjustment amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "And…most of the text you see in the box would be the\n",
    "business rules…which specify how to calculate the\n",
    "adjustment given the input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Space Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/46.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first technique that will help us to design tests is\n",
    "called input space partitioning.\n",
    "Input space partitioning is used to partition the input\n",
    "side of a function into a set of equivalence classes that\n",
    "can help us identify test conditions.\n",
    "An equivalence class is a subset of the input domain\n",
    "such that any values in that class will result in an\n",
    "equivalent system response.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a person who is 29 years old and has no\n",
    "claims will have the same adjustment as a person who is\n",
    "40 and has no claims. Similarly, a person who is 21 with\n",
    "3 claims will have the same adjustment as someone who\n",
    "is 25 and has 3 claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also model the invalid equivalence classes. In this\n",
    "example, two invalid classes are age less than the\n",
    "minimum allowed and a negative number of claims. We\n",
    "could also set up an invalid equivalence class for invalid\n",
    "types, but we won‘t do that to keep things simple.\n",
    "Modeling the inputs of a function using equivalence\n",
    "classes helps us to see possibilitied for reducing the number of tests we need to develop and to ensure we\n",
    "adequately cover the input possibilities...and helps in\n",
    "the boundary testing technique as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we could generate test cases, by essentially\n",
    "taking random values that fall within each of the\n",
    "equivalence classes. For example, we could have a test\n",
    "case for a person who is 24 and has 1 claim, and a\n",
    "person who is 24 and has 3 claims, and a person who is\n",
    "33 and has no claims, and a person who is 33 and has 4\n",
    "claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/47.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next technique is the boundary testing technique…\n",
    "and here’s a formal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary testing focuses on identifying test conditions\n",
    "at the extreme points of the equivalence classes.\n",
    "In the premium adjustment example we would use this\n",
    "technique to write test cases around the boundaries of\n",
    "the two input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So…maybe we’ll add tests for someone who is 25 and\n",
    "has no claims, someone who is 25 and has 1 claim,\n",
    "someone who is at the minimum age with no claims,\n",
    "someone at the minimum age with one claim, someone\n",
    "at the minimum age with 2 claims, someone below the\n",
    "minimum age with 1 claim, and someone below the\n",
    "minimum age with a negative number of claims.\n",

    "### Sample Business Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/48.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in the course we discussed using decision tables\n",
    "to document complex business rules as part of the\n",
    "requirements phase in a project. Decision tables can also\n",
    "be used to help us design test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example in which a step in the use case\n",
    "requires the software product to make a calculation. The\n",
    "business rules for the calculation are pretty complex,\n",
    "and have been documented in narrative form. The\n",
    "narrative is clear and nicely structured…but the rules are\n",
    "innately complex. From the testing perspective, how\n",
    "many test cases should be used to test this function? It’s\n",
    "not obvious at all, is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use a decision table to model the business rules\n",
    "and see if that can help us out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Table Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/49.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the decision table. It has six columns,\n",
    "corresponding to the basic functional combinations\n",
    "specified in the business rules. So…we can write a test\n",
    "for each column in the table and we’ll be certain that all\n",
    "the basic combinations are covered. Pretty simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also apply the boundary and input space\n",
    "partitioning techniques to get a full set of test cases.\n",
    "Now, if a decision table had been used in the\n",
    "requirements, we’d save a lot more time developing test\n",
    "cases, wouldn’t we? I actually worked on a project in\n",
    "which almost 50% of the expected test effort was saved\n",
    "because the business analysts used decision tables for\n",
    "specifying complex business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/50.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another technique is to use decision trees. This is a\n",
    "decision tree for the order discount business rules.\n",
    "The node at the left-most part of the tree is called the\n",
    "root of the tree. The straight lines are called the\n",
    "branches of the tree, and the nodes at the right-most\n",
    "end of the tree are called the leaves of the tree. Each set\n",
    "of branches emanating from a node corresponds to\n",
    "possible equivalence classes for one of the input\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You read the tree from left to right. As an example...if we\n",
    "have a transactions for a customer that provides more\n",
    "than a million dollars in revenue , and the order quantity\n",
    "is 800 widgets , then the order discount will be 8\n",
    "percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tree, each path from the root of the tree to a leaf\n",
    "on the tree corresponds to a column in the prior\n",
    "decision table. There are 6 paths, corresponding to the 6\n",
    "columns in the decision table example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are more useful than decision tables\n",
    "when there is a business rule algorithm that requires\n",
    "iterating through steps more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-Driven Test design\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/51.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques I just discussed are all examples of model-driven\n",
    "test design. We started with a requirement, modeled its business\n",
    "rules, and then used the model to help generate test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using these techniques we can quickly estimate how\n",
    "many test cases would be required...without having to actually\n",
    "come up with specific test case data. That‘s very powerful...because\n",
    "it can help with estimating total test effort very quickly during the\n",
    "test planning activity. And...if we applied the techniques over and\n",
    "over, we‘d come up with pretty much the same number of test\n",

    "Code-based testing, also called white box testing, involves\n",
    "designing tests by using the code itself as one of the inputs to the\n",

    "coverage. Each of these is at least as thorough as the others...with\n",
    "statement coverage being the least thorough and\n",
    "decision/condition coverage being the most thorough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/54.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Statement coverage involves writing enough tests so\n",
    "that each programming statement in the component\n",
    "under test is exercised at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at this example…a simple C++ function that\n",
    "gets passed three floating point variables when it is\n",
    "called. We’ll assume that this is the component under\n",
    "test. Now, I just made up the code for this function, and\n",
    "it’s not important that it really do anything meaningful\n",
    "for purposes of this discussion…because I just want to\n",
    "focus on coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve statement coverage we need to write\n",
    "enough tests so that each statement is executed at\n",
    "least once…and this can be done with a single test case.\n",
    "Now, let’s think about the adequacy of statement\n",
    "coverage. Here’s a flow chart for the function . Note\n",
    "that I didn’t bother to include an element for the return\n",
    "statement, since it will always be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one test case that exercises all statements would\n",
    "exercise the execution path a-c-e. But, there is a second\n",
    "execution path a-b-d, and this would not be covered by\n",
    "our test. And…there are two complex conditional tests\n",
    "here. Suppose the comparison in the second test was\n",
    "supposed to be X equals 1 and not X greater than one.\n",
    "That error would not be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "So…as a coverage criteria in practice…even though it is\n",
    "commonly used…statement coverage is not adequate\n",
    "since the risk of not detecting errors can be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branch Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/55.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next higher coverage criteria is branch or decision\n",
    "coverage. For branch coverage we need to write\n",
    "enough tests so that each true/false branch is exercised\n",
    "at least once. In practice, branch coverage is a very\n",
    "common coverage criteria and is at least as thorough as\n",
    "statement coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, two test cases would do the job…and\n",
    "would also exercise the two control flow paths…so\n",
    "that’s certainly better coverage than statement\n",
    "coverage. But…what about those compound\n",
    "conditionals. They could be evaluated as true or false in\n",
    "quite a few different ways…so some errors could slip\n",
    "through undetected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision / Condition Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/56.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next type of coverage criteria is decision/condition\n",
    "coverage. This requires that we write enough tests so\n",
    "that each true/false decision branch is executed at least\n",
    "once and all combinations that can cause a decision to\n",
    "be true and false be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our sample function, there are four combinations\n",
    "that would need to be tested for the first decision and\n",
    "four for the second decision, as illustrated here. As you\n",
    "can see, that’s a lot of work…but it’s a lot more\n",
    "thorough than statement or branch coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom line here is that an organization needs to\n",
    "set coverage criteria that makes sense and mitigates\n",
    "risk to an acceptable level. As I mentioned in an earlier\n",
    "lecture…testing is an exercise in risk management.\n",
    "And…as we saw in these examples…some combination\n",
    "of statements, branches, conditions, and execution\n",
    "paths are all involved in ensuring reasonable test\n",
    "coverage…so it can be quite challenging to design an\n",
    "adequate set of test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basis Path Testing Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/57.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It‘s one thing to specify coverage criteria and another thing for\n",
    "engineers to be able to design tests that satisfy that criteria other\n",
    "than by hit or miss. Fortunately…there are techniques that can\n",
    "help us do this pretty easily. One technique, called basis path\n",
    "testing, is pretty straightforward to apply and yields a very high\n",
    "degree of statement, branch, condition, and path coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique utilizes the cyclomatic complexity that you learned\n",
    "about in the module on software quality metrics. Let‘s see how it\n",
    "works.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/58.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the cyclomatic complexity metric was\n",
    "introduced as a measure of the complexity of a\n",
    "software component’s control flow logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of formulas that can be used to\n",
    "calculate cyclomatic complexity. One way is to count\n",
    "the number of decision keywords, the number of ands\n",
    "and ors, and then add one. In this example of a Java\n",
    "method, there are five decision keywords, highlighted\n",
    "in blue, and three “and” keywords, highlighted in\n",
    "red…so the cyclomatic complexity of the method is 9.\n",
    "So…how does this relate to testing? Let’s find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/59.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclomatic complexity and basis path testing have their\n",
    "roots in mathematics. While it’s not necessary to know\n",
    "or understand the mathematics, I think they’re quite\n",
    "interesting and are worth a short discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever taken physics or linear algebra you’ve\n",
    "probably been exposed to the concept of a vector\n",
    "space. Here’s a simple example in case you haven’t.\n",
    "Suppose I wanted to make a two-dimensional\n",
    "plot…maybe plot some points as illustrated here. Now\n",
    "the X and Y axes form a basis for a two-dimensional\n",
    "vector space. There are a countably infinite number of\n",
    "points that can be drawn in two-dimensional space, but\n",
    "only two pieces of information are required to describe\n",
    "any of those points…a distance along the x-axis and a\n",
    "distance along the y-axis. Note that the x and y axes are\n",
    "perpendicular, or orthogonal, to each other. In\n",
    "mathematical terms we would say that they are\n",
    "independent axes…we can’t express x in terms of y and\n",
    "vice versa…hence, they form the basis of a two-\n",
    "dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…a little bit of history behind cyclomatic\n",
    "complexity and how it relates to basis path testing. This\n",
    "metric comes from graph theory. The flowchart for a\n",
    "software component can be considered to be a form of\n",
    "a mathematical graph. And, there’s a theorem in math\n",
    "that says that all the paths through a graph are\n",
    "members of a vector space…and that the dimension of\n",
    "that vector space equals the cyclomatic number\n",
    "associated with the graph. For software, the paths\n",
    "correspond to execution paths and the cyclomatic\n",
    "number corresponds to the cyclomatic complexity.\n",
    "The theorem further states that there exist at least one\n",
    "set of paths, called a basis set, that have the following\n",
    "properties: first, they are independent from one\n",
    "another…kind of like our x and y axes but at a more\n",
    "complex level…and second…the remaining paths in\n",
    "their vector space can be generated with a simple\n",
    "linear combinations of the basis set paths…kind of like\n",
    "every point in two-dimensional space can be\n",
    "constructed from an x value and a y value.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a testing standpoint, suppose we have a software\n",
    "component that has a cyclomatic complexity of five.\n",
    "And, suppose it has a thousand possible execution\n",
    "paths. The cyclomatic theorem tells us that there exists\n",
    "at least one set of 5 paths that are independent from\n",
    "one another, and from which the remaining 995 could\n",
    "be constructed. So, in some respects, if we found those\n",
    "5 basis paths and tested them, then all the remaining\n",
    "execution paths could be formed from some\n",
    "combination of those five…so some would say that\n",
    "testing more than the basis paths is, in some respects,\n",
    "redundant. So…how can we use this in practice?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if we find a set of basis paths for a software\n",
    "component and test those paths, guess what? Every\n",
    "statement, branch, and condition will also be exercised.\n",
    "So…we can use basis path testing as a quick way of\n",
    "coming up with an effective covering set of test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/60.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s re-visit our earlier example. Here’s the code for\n",
    "our very simple method and an associated flowchart. I\n",
    "wrote the flowchart a little differently than before…by\n",
    "breaking down the compound decision constructs into\n",
    "primitive level decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a few seconds to calculate the cyclomatic\n",
    "complexity of this method. It should be five. There are\n",
    "two “if” keywords, an “and” keyword represented by\n",

    "double vertical bar. Adding one yields a cyclomatic\n",
    "complexity of five.\n",
    "\n",
    "And… here’s a set of basis paths. If we develop a set of\n",
