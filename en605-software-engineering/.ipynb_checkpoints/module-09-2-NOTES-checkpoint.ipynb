    "# 9F: Static OO Design Modeling using UML\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now begin our discussion of the design class diagram. Even though we use UML notation for both the analysis and design class diagrams, they are distinct models. For one thing, we will use more UML notation in design than we did in analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Levels of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/12.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the classes that we modeled in the analysis will reappear in the design class diagram, but there may be some differences, which we’ll discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall level of abstraction in the design class diagram is much lower. We are creating models of the code now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the issues we will get into will seem to many people to be coding level issues. However, since the design is an abstraction of the code, these are really design level decisions. It just turns out that most of the time, people skip the design step and go right into coding. Of course, they seem like coding decisions, since they haven’t done the design. This doesn’t change the fact that they are truly design decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many of the decisions that we are forced to make in programming are in fact design decisions. It is my contention that many decisions that we make in coding should be made in the design modeling instead. These decisions have to be made sometime, and it’s better to make them and model them in a more abstract notation like the design class diagram or sequence diagram than it is to try to make these decisions when we are at the much lower level of abstraction of the programming language. If the decision needs to be changed, it is much easier to do in the UML than it is in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Most Analysis Entity Classes are also in the Design (but some may not be)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the entity classes in the analysis class diagram will appear in the design class diagram as well. However, there may be some good reasons why one or more of the analysis classes is not part of the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may turn out that one of the classes in the analysis model is better implemented as two or more smaller classes in the design. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or we may go the other way, and combine two or more smaller classes in the analysis into one in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is that what we thought of as a class in analysis is actually more appropriately modeled as an attribute in the design. Maybe what we thought of as a class in the analysis is actually an external subsystem, and wouldn’t appear in the design at all. What looked like inheritance at analysis time might actually be better realized as a flag attribute in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used boundary and controller classes in our analysis modeling, these may not be necessary in design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classes Introduced at Design Time\n",
    "\n",
    "We may introduce new classes into the design. Even if we didn’t use controllers at analysis time, we may wish to create controller objects in the design. This is especially true if we are using a pattern such as the model-view-controller. We’ll talk about this and other patterns in another module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will need to introduce objects to represent the information that is modeled as links in the analysis. When one object is linked to another object, the information about the two objects being linked needs to be stored somewhere. It may be stored in either of the linked objects (or both, even). But another approach would be to create a third object that contains the information about the two objects being linked. We’ll see more on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may need to introduce objects to improve performance, provide for persistence, concurrency, interfacing to other subsystems, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating the Design Class Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we use much of the same UML notation in the design class diagram that we did in the analysis model, it is a good idea to start fresh with the design class diagram rather than to try to evolve the analysis class diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably will need to develop the dynamic model at the same time as you are working on the static model. This is an iterative process. Neither the static nor dynamic part can be done in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we identify classes that belong in the design, we add them to the class diagram. \n",
    "- Start with the classes in the analysis model. \n",
    "- Eliminate any objects that are simply attributes of another object. \n",
    "- Eliminate any objects that are outside the system. \n",
    "- Split any really complicated classes into multiple, more cohesive classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll discuss ways of doing this later on. Introduce coordinator and controller objects that may be needed in the dynamic models.\n",

    "# 9G: Implementing Associations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will begin our discussion of implementing class relationships in the design class diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Links = Object References\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/13.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we created the analysis class diagram, we showed relationships between classes. As you recall, most of these relationships represent information about the linking of objects… information that needs to be remembered over time. We said that this information is shared by the two objects being linked. We specifically said that the linkage information is not stored in either of the objects being linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was analysis. This is design. In design, ALL information, whether it is attributes or link information, all information is stored as attributes inside objects. There is no information floating around outside of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, linkage information must be stored as attributes in the design model. The question comes down to, where should this linkage information be stored? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two objects being linked. That means that the linkage information could be stored in either of those objects. Or, it could be stored in some other object. As long as the information is stored. That’s what is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linkage information is stored as object references or pointers. The precise terminology depends on the programming language. In this course, we will try to use the term object reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object reference is a piece of data. It can be stored in a variable. The data type of that variable is the class of the object being referenced. More precisely, the data type of the variable can be either the class of the object being references, or any of the ancestor classes up the inheritance hierarchy. Also, since an object reference is data, it can be passed around as an argument or return result in the invocation of an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Directionality\n",
    "\n",
    "In the design class diagram, when we make the decision about where the object reference is to be stored, we will represent that information by putting an arrow head on one end of the association line. This directed association looks like a pointer from the class where the object reference is stored to the class being referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In UML this is sometimes referred to as navigability, as if the association is a path to be navigated. I think this is the wrong way to look at associations. As we have pointed out before, associations represent information. They are not to be viewed as conduits for sending messages. Thus the idea of navigating associations doesn’t make sense. In order to send a message to an object, all you need is the reference to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference doesn’t need to be stored as an attribute of the sending object. It could just be a local variable in the operation sending the message. We will discuss how the object reference could be put into this local variable in the video on dynamic modeling in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining the Directionality\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/14.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, navigability does play a role in deciding where to store the object reference. If the object reference is stored as an attribute of an object, a message can easily be sent to the referenced object. The object being referenced can’t send a message to the referencing object very easily because it doesn’t have a stored reference. So, if we want to optimize message sending in one direction, we can use that decision to tell us where to store the object reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, here are the three choices we have. \n",
    "- A could store the reference to B, \n",
    "- B could store the reference to A,\n",
    "- or a third object, C, could store a reference to both A and B. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you decide? It depends on which way you want to optimize the navigation. This, of course, depends on a good understanding of the system operations, and their probabilities of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplicities Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the multiplicity on each end of the association is 1, then storing the link is easy. You just put a referential attribute variable in the referencing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the multiplicity is greater than one, an object instance of the one class has to be able to point to many object instances of the second class. This means that the object must store a collection of references. This collection is a set, by default. There is no left to right order of the links.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted the links to be ordered in some way, then you would have placed a constraint such as {ordered} or {FIFO} on the association. Maybe you didn’t think to do this in analysis, but now, in design, you realize that you should put the links in some kind of order. You can go back and change the analysis model. If the association in the analysis class diagram has an {ordered} constraint, the collection used in design would be some kind of ordered collection such as a list or vector.\n",

    "# 9H: Implementing Aggregations & Compositions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will continue our discussion of implementing relationships between classes. If we see an aggregation or composition relationship between two classes in the analysis class diagram, how should we implement that relationship in the design class diagram?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/17.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the easier one first: aggregation. As we discussed in our analysis module, aggregation is just a special kind of association that has the inherent meaning, “contains” or “part of.” It has a special symbol, an open diamond on the aggregator end of the association. Beyond that, it should be treated as a regular association in terms of its implementation in the design class diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let’s talk about directionality. Where should the linkage information be stored? In the aggregator, or in the part? Most people would say, “Put the links in the aggregator class,” and leave it at that. But the answer isn’t always so easy. We really have to look at the dynamic models to see whether they would be more optimized by storing the links in the aggregator or the part. If the links are stored in the parts, each part object is aware of its aggregator, but the aggregator doesn’t know its parts. If the links are stored in the aggregator, it can see its parts, but the parts can’t see their aggregator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there’s multiplicity. The multiplicity on the diamond end of the aggregation is usually one, but not always. It may be possible to have a situation where an object can be part of multiple aggregations at the same time. Think of an employee object. It could be part of a department aggregation. It also could be part of a union aggregation at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the way we deal with multiplicity is exactly the same as for regular associations. If the multiplicity on the far side of the relationship is greater than one, then you’ll need a collection of object references. Once again, by default this collection is an unordered set. If you need order, then you can use an ordered collection, such as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compositions\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/18.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Compositions are the relationships with the solid diamond on the composite end of the relationship. Compositions are much more highly constrained than aggregations. We discussed these constraints when we talked about compositions in the static analysis module. These constraints make the choices for implementing compositions a bit more limited than for aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Composition Constrains\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/19.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s recall the constraints implied by a composition relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite fully encapsulates the parts. All communication to the parts is controlled by the composite. Usually this means that all messages that are sent to the parts are sent by the composite. If you need to get a message to a part, you must send it to the composite, which will, in turn, send a message to the part.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that no object other than the composite may be linked to the part objects. A part may only be contained in one composite at any point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifetime of the parts is completely controlled by the composite. This means that part objects are only constructed by or on behalf of the composite. The parts are also destroyed by or on behalf of the composite only. This is sometimes referred to as the “cascading delete rule.” If the composite goes away, so do its parts. When we say “destroyed,” it means different things in different languages. In some languages, you must send a destructor message to an object to have it clean itself up, and return its memory to the free space list. In other languages, this is done by a garbage collector when all references to the object are deleted. This is partly the reason for the exclusive ownership rule. If the composite is the only object containing links to the part, if the composite goes away, so do the links to its part objects. Since these are the only links to these objects, the objects can be garbage collected. In a language without garbage collectors, you must make sure the composite sends the destructor messages to all of its parts as part of its own destructor method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that the directionality of the composite relationship must always be from the composite to the parts. The links are stored in the composite. Usually the multiplicity on the part end of the relationship has a multiplicity of greater than one. This, of course, means that the links are stored in a collection. And, again, by default this is a set. If you need order, then you’ll have to use an ordered collection.\n",

    "# 9I: Object Lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point in this module, we have mainly been talking about ways to implement things we see in the analysis class diagram in the design class diagram. Things such as associations, multiplicity, aggregations, compositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll deal with some more of that later, when we get into implementing generalization/specialization relationships. But we can’t go too far without discussing a very important topic: object lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need to lookup objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/20.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In many systems, involving multiple subsystems that have to communicate with each other by sending messages, these messages my contain references to specific objects. However, unless some sort of object-oriented inter-process communication mechanism is used, in which serialized objects can be sent from one subsystem to the other, these object references are typically in the form of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object instance of a particular class will have a unique key value associated with it, and stored as an attribute. The object instance can then be located by using that unique key. We will need an operation to translate a key value into an object reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/21.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lookup may be implemented in many ways. You studied these techniques in the Data Structures class. Fortunately most modern languages and environments support efficient mechanisms such as hash maps that make the implementation of the lookup relatively easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where to put lookup operation\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/22.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for other objects in the system to be able to invoke this lookup operation, it needs to be visible to all of them. The best way to accomplish this is to make the lookup operation globally visible. We could do this in two ways. One would be to put the lookup operation in a singleton object. One thing about singletons is that they are globally visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option, and the one we will choose here, is to add the lookup operation as a static operation to the class of the objects we want to look up. As you know, static operations are invoked by messages sent to the class rather than an object instance. Thus static operations have the same visibility as classes, which make them globally visible. Remember that we indicate a static operation with underline font.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/23.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider our Internet storefront system. The system operations for finding products in the catalog and then adding the product to an order are quite loosely coupled. In some implementations, there may some kind of session memory that is retained between the two system operations. The two system operations may communicate through the session, in which objects can be shared. In many cases, though, these two system operations are not coupled through shared session memory. Thus if one system operation needed to send an object reference to another system operation, it would have to rely on key values. In our storefront system, the system operation, Add Item to Order, has two inputs: the Product to be added to the order, and the quantity of this product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity is an integer. No problem. The question is, how do we transmit the Product object instance from the client to the server? If there’s no object-oriented inter-process communication, this is usually done by keys. So, the client passes a key value that corresponds uniquely to the object instance of the Product that is to be added to the order. It is now up to the server to translate that key value into an object reference to the correct object instance of Product. We need a Product lookup operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will need to be a static operation in the Product class to map the key to the object reference. This operation name usually has the verb get or find or lookup in it. The argument to this operation is the key value. The result is an object reference to an object instance of Product.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism for the lookup may be a hash table or b-tree or some other data structure that is optimized for searching. It would have to be stored in the Product class as a static attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will probably need to be operations for managing the lookup information, too. You might see an operation to add a new object, as well as an operation to delete an object from the lookup.\n",

    "# 9J: Implementing Generalization-Specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we will discuss options for handling generalization/specialization, or inheritance, in design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flag Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/24.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the time, when we see generalization specialization relationships in the analysis model, it is because the analysts noticed that there was what they might call a “kind-of” relationship between classes. Concepts like polymorphism aren’t usually employed in the analysis model. You see polymorphism more in the design model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, frequently, when we have one of these “kind of” relationships in the analysis, and there are no overridden operations, implementing this as inheritance in the design might be overkill. A better approach might be to just use a flag attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/25.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you handle this situation in design? There are two kinds of employees: blue collar and white collar. Blue collar employees are paid by the hour and get paid for overtime. White collar employees get an annual salary and are not paid for overtime. All employees have lots of attributes in common, such as name, social security number, hire date, address, etc. All employees have a pay() operation. There may be other objects that are linked to and from employee objects. In this diagram, they are shown in red.\n",
    "\n",
    "In analysis, when we hear that there are two “kinds of” employees, our first thought is to model this “kind of” relationship as generalization- specification. You can see this here. This is actually the design model in which the decisions about implementation of the links have been made\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/26.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a problem with this approach. Say we want to promote an employee from blue collar to white collar.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t convert an object instance of one class into an object instance of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to promote a blue collar employee object, you’d have to create a completely new white collar employee object instance, copy the attributes over from the old blue collar employee object instance, link the new white collar object in where the blue collar one was, and destroy the blue collar object. This is especially difficult if other objects point to the employee object (such as the Union object in our illustration here). We’d have to send a message to the union object to tell it that it is pointing to the wrong object, and tell it which new object to point to,\n",
    "\n",
    "In the instance diagram shown here, things in red are to be discarded. The things in green are to be created. This isn’t a very elegant way to approach this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A better way\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/27.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a better way. Instead of using generalization specialization to represent what is shared between white collar and blue collar classes, we use aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregate class (in this case, Employee) holds the information that doesn’t change if the employment type changes. The Employee class delegates to the Contract class, which uses generalization-specialization to represent what is different between the two types of employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This use of aggregation rather than generalization is called the state pattern. We’ll see more patterns later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Much easier to change\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/28.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works. We want to change Al from a blue collar to a white collar employee. All of Al’s information stays the same. All of the links to and from the Employee object are unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a new instance of a WhiteCollar contract, point to it from the Employee object, and destroy the old BlueCollar contract object. No need to move data. No need to swizzle links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introducing Inheritance Design\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod09/29.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we can introduce inheritance at design time. During analysis, we identify classes in the problem domain. At design time, consider dividing some of the classes into two parts, a general part and a specific part. The general part becomes an abstract superclass. The specific part becomes a concrete subclass. More subclasses can be easily added later if you discover other specializations\n",
