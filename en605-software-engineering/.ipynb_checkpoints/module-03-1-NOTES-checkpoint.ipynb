    "## Project Management\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **project** is a temporary endeavor that is undertaken to create a unique product or service. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a SWE PoV, the result could be a software product or modification to an existing software. One key point is that a project is **temporary** - it has a start-point and end-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Project Management** is the application of many different things that go into the creation of a product. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project management can be seen as the application of: knowledge, skills ,tools, techniques in order to meet **stakeholder** needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders and their **needs** need to be clearly defined early on in the project management cycle. A common problem when stakeholders are not identified or collaborated with is that the product could be incorrect, incomplete or adversely impact the customer organization's process and work flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **stakeholder** is anyone who is directly or indirectly impacted by the product or service that will be created from the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Management Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/01.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several processes that occur during a project:\n",
    "- **Project initiation** gets the ball rolling on a project\n",
    "- **Planning process** \n",
    "- Activities that deal with the actual creation of the product / software (**execution**)\n",
    "- **Tracking and control** used to monitor progress and make any adjustments if needed \n",
    "- Since projects are temporary, there's typically a **closure** where the product is **delivered**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tracking and control** is ongoing and it is designed to accomodate for changing requirements or staffing changes etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of **supporting processes** (called **umbrella processes**) that span the duration of the project. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quality Assurance\n",
    "- Configuration management\n",
    "- Requirements management\n",
    "\n",
    "On very small project teams, these umbrella processes will be done by the core team who are doing the main processes too. However, on larger teams in larger organizations these umbrella processes could have dedicated teams just doing those supporting activities (for example an entire QA team). \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of project initiation and project closures; they’re pretty straightforward. **Project initiation** typically involves activities such as \n",
    "- feasibility studies, \n",
    "- concept definition, \n",
    "- problem definition, \n",
    "- identifying key product features, \n",
    "- and stakeholder analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various work products may come out of this process the key ones being what is commonly called:\n",
    "- A **vision document** or statement that describes the overall problem or opportunity, describes:\n",
    "    - the project scope, \n",
    "    - specifies key product features, \n",
    "    - and specifies key stakeholders. \n",
    "- A **project charter** is also a common output of project initiation. It is created to: \n",
    "    - formally communicate that the project exists, \n",
    "     - and will usually document things like project scope (if that hasn’t been done in a vision document), \n",
    "     - identify the project manager and other key organizational managers, \n",
    "     - and often it will describe decision-making authorities, and chain of command. \n",
    "     - It may also identify staff members, and roles and responsibilities. \n",
    "     \n",
    "## When things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common that projects go wrong because the seeds of failure are sown at the beginning as a result of poor project planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The first most common thing managers do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common thing managers do when a project goes wrong is to throw more money at it. When this happens it is a strong indication that the budget or schedule was infeasable in the first place - which is a result of **poor planning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poor planning isn't the only thing that can end a project in a bad place. Another thing is **poor understanding** of project requirements and deliverables. This can lead to unanticipated requirement changes, which in turn can lead to budget and schedule overruns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The second most common thing managers do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing managers often do is to **add more staff**. \"But adding more people to a late project makes it later\" (Barry Boehm). Adding more people to certain projects will make it fast (like painting a house where people can work in parallel). However, with software project, there are often **dependencies** at play. There are a certain set of “physics” associated with software projects - certain activities have to be done in a particular order, and there is a limit to how much division of labor is feasible and these physics can’t really be tampered with. Adding staff almost always increases cost and doesn’t necessarily shorten the schedule significantly if at all. It also contributes to increased project risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the other issues with adding more staff is the the **number of lines of communication** increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/02.png\" width=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the number of communications for each team member (node) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the number of staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges a project manager faces is to keep everyone in synch with a project’s current status and the time it takes to do that **increases non-linearly** as the team size increases. Also,  if one person misses or misinterprets a piece of key information, that can impact some or all of the entire project team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with adding more staff is that people end up doing **multi-tasking** (for example, if they were on other projects but now need to be added to this project that is in trouble). When people multi-task, their productivity goes down and it will not only affect the already in trouble project, but will also affect the original project they were working on before they were staffed on the in trouble one. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The third most common thing managers do**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another thing PMs do when a project gets into trouble is to **add more project oversight**. An example of this is increasing the number of meetings - for example, from once a week to twice a week. Increasing oversight often increases **cost** because oversight meetings are generally not budgeted for. If you have 4 team members and an hour oversight meeting is scheduled, then that's an additional 4 person-hours of effort that's not been budgeted for which is 2 person-days over the course of a month. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will also obviously take away from the time that the team could spend actually working on the project. \n",

    "## Project Planning Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of project planning is to come up with a plan for executing and managing the product development effort. This model shows some of the typical inputs, tools & techniques, and typical outputs of project planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/03.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key output is a **project plan**. Other outputs might include things like a risk management plan, a communications plan, and plans for supporting processes like quality assurance and configuration management. Sometimes these additional plans are included as sections within the project plan document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What your plan must communicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHAT, WHEN, HOW, WHO\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some minimal things that a project plan should communicate to all project stakeholders. It must describe\n",
    "- **what:** will be delivered. This is usually done by specifying the characteristics of the product to be built and the specific project deliverables that will be produced over the course of the project.\n",
    "- **when**: The plan must also describe **when** the product will be delivered, and when the major tasks and **milestones** will be completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **milestone** is a reference point that marks a significant project event. Milestones are used to measure project progress. Examples of project milestones include things like completing the requirements phase or design phase, achieving customer acceptance of the final product, and so forth. In practice, people often confuse milestones with work tasks. Milestones occur as the end result of a set of work tasks, but milestones themselves are not work tasks they have no duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **how**: A project plan must also describe **how** the project work will be done, usually by specifying a project life cycle and an associated set of work tasks (called a **work breakdown structure**) as well as how the project progress will be monitored and communicated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **who**: And it must also specify **who** is going to do the work by identifying project staff roles and responsibilities as well as customer and other stakeholder roles and responsibilities. This is often accomplished using something called a **work responsibility matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example what a project plan could look like**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/04.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above communicates the **WHO, WHAT, WHEN, and HOW** - and even more - like supporting processes (like QA and configuration management etc) \n",
