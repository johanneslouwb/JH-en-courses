    "## Project Management\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **project** is a temporary endeavor that is undertaken to create a unique product or service. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a SWE PoV, the result could be a software product or modification to an existing software. One key point is that a project is **temporary** - it has a start-point and end-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Project Management** is the application of many different things that go into the creation of a product. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project management can be seen as the application of: knowledge, skills ,tools, techniques in order to meet **stakeholder** needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders and their **needs** need to be clearly defined early on in the project management cycle. A common problem when stakeholders are not identified or collaborated with is that the product could be incorrect, incomplete or adversely impact the customer organization's process and work flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **stakeholder** is anyone who is directly or indirectly impacted by the product or service that will be created from the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Management Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/01.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several processes that occur during a project:\n",
    "- **Project initiation** gets the ball rolling on a project\n",
    "- **Planning process** \n",
    "- Activities that deal with the actual creation of the product / software (**execution**)\n",
    "- **Tracking and control** used to monitor progress and make any adjustments if needed \n",
    "- Since projects are temporary, there's typically a **closure** where the product is **delivered**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tracking and control** is ongoing and it is designed to accomodate for changing requirements or staffing changes etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also a number of **supporting processes** (called **umbrella processes**) that span the duration of the project. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quality Assurance\n",
    "- Configuration management\n",
    "- Requirements management\n",
    "\n",
    "On very small project teams, these umbrella processes will be done by the core team who are doing the main processes too. However, on larger teams in larger organizations these umbrella processes could have dedicated teams just doing those supporting activities (for example an entire QA team). \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of project initiation and project closures; they’re pretty straightforward. **Project initiation** typically involves activities such as \n",
    "- feasibility studies, \n",
    "- concept definition, \n",
    "- problem definition, \n",
    "- identifying key product features, \n",
    "- and stakeholder analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various work products may come out of this process the key ones being what is commonly called:\n",
    "- A **vision document** or statement that describes the overall problem or opportunity, describes:\n",
    "    - the project scope, \n",
    "    - specifies key product features, \n",
    "    - and specifies key stakeholders. \n",
    "- A **project charter** is also a common output of project initiation. It is created to: \n",
    "    - formally communicate that the project exists, \n",
    "     - and will usually document things like project scope (if that hasn’t been done in a vision document), \n",
    "     - identify the project manager and other key organizational managers, \n",
    "     - and often it will describe decision-making authorities, and chain of command. \n",
    "     - It may also identify staff members, and roles and responsibilities. \n",
    "     \n",
    "## When things go wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common that projects go wrong because the seeds of failure are sown at the beginning as a result of poor project planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The first most common thing managers do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common thing managers do when a project goes wrong is to throw more money at it. When this happens it is a strong indication that the budget or schedule was infeasable in the first place - which is a result of **poor planning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poor planning isn't the only thing that can end a project in a bad place. Another thing is **poor understanding** of project requirements and deliverables. This can lead to unanticipated requirement changes, which in turn can lead to budget and schedule overruns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The second most common thing managers do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing managers often do is to **add more staff**. \"But adding more people to a late project makes it later\" (Barry Boehm). Adding more people to certain projects will make it fast (like painting a house where people can work in parallel). However, with software project, there are often **dependencies** at play. There are a certain set of “physics” associated with software projects - certain activities have to be done in a particular order, and there is a limit to how much division of labor is feasible and these physics can’t really be tampered with. Adding staff almost always increases cost and doesn’t necessarily shorten the schedule significantly if at all. It also contributes to increased project risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the other issues with adding more staff is the the **number of lines of communication** increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/02.png\" width=100>\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the number of communications for each team member (node) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the number of staff. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges a project manager faces is to keep everyone in synch with a project’s current status and the time it takes to do that **increases non-linearly** as the team size increases. Also,  if one person misses or misinterprets a piece of key information, that can impact some or all of the entire project team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue with adding more staff is that people end up doing **multi-tasking** (for example, if they were on other projects but now need to be added to this project that is in trouble). When people multi-task, their productivity goes down and it will not only affect the already in trouble project, but will also affect the original project they were working on before they were staffed on the in trouble one. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The third most common thing managers do**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another thing PMs do when a project gets into trouble is to **add more project oversight**. An example of this is increasing the number of meetings - for example, from once a week to twice a week. Increasing oversight often increases **cost** because oversight meetings are generally not budgeted for. If you have 4 team members and an hour oversight meeting is scheduled, then that's an additional 4 person-hours of effort that's not been budgeted for which is 2 person-days over the course of a month. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will also obviously take away from the time that the team could spend actually working on the project. \n",

    "## Project Planning Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of project planning is to come up with a plan for executing and managing the product development effort. This model shows some of the typical inputs, tools & techniques, and typical outputs of project planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/03.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key output is a **project plan**. Other outputs might include things like a risk management plan, a communications plan, and plans for supporting processes like quality assurance and configuration management. Sometimes these additional plans are included as sections within the project plan document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What your plan must communicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHAT, WHEN, HOW, WHO\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some minimal things that a project plan should communicate to all project stakeholders. It must describe\n",
    "- **what:** will be delivered. This is usually done by specifying the characteristics of the product to be built and the specific project deliverables that will be produced over the course of the project.\n",
    "- **when**: The plan must also describe **when** the product will be delivered, and when the major tasks and **milestones** will be completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **milestone** is a reference point that marks a significant project event. Milestones are used to measure project progress. Examples of project milestones include things like completing the requirements phase or design phase, achieving customer acceptance of the final product, and so forth. In practice, people often confuse milestones with work tasks. Milestones occur as the end result of a set of work tasks, but milestones themselves are not work tasks they have no duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **how**: A project plan must also describe **how** the project work will be done, usually by specifying a project life cycle and an associated set of work tasks (called a **work breakdown structure**) as well as how the project progress will be monitored and communicated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **who**: And it must also specify **who** is going to do the work by identifying project staff roles and responsibilities as well as customer and other stakeholder roles and responsibilities. This is often accomplished using something called a **work responsibility matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example what a project plan could look like**:\n",

    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/04.png\" width=600>\n",

    "## Project Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what kind of things get estimated during the planning process, let's look at ***how*** it is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 techniques: **(1)** Expert Judgement, **(2)** Structured Group, **(3)** Rule of Thumb, **(4)** Algorithmic, **(5)** Activity Based \n",
    "\n",
    "### (1) Expert Judgement\n",
    "\n",
    "Widely used; it relies on the judgment and experience of individuals who will apply their knowledge to the project at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Works best when you have: \n",
    "- experts to actually call upon, \n",
    "- when there is real historical information that can be accessed, \n",
    "- when a structured process is used, \n",
    "- and when the basis for the estimates is documented and communicated to project stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mileage on expert judgement varies. It depends how similar the project is or if they have experience with the type of project at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) Structured Group Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Is also an estimating technique - but better than expert judgement. Here you have ***multiple*** estimators who follow a structured process to reach their estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such technique is the **Delphi Method** and it has a number of variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/06.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Delphi technique is for use on “never done before” projects in order to get a reasonable ballpark estimate of project effort, cost, or schedule. It uses a panel of expert estimators usually at least three, a coordinator, and a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinator distributes project background information and estimating forms to each estimator. Each estimator prepares an estimate, anonymously, and documents their rationale. If they have questions, they may consult with the coordinator, but they can’t consult with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinator then summarizes the estimates. If the coordinator determines that the estimates are close enough so that a reasonable range estimate can be formed, the process stops. Otherwise, the estimates and rationale are summarized and given to the estimators, and another iteration takes place. Estimators know the other estimates, and the rationale that others used, but they don’t know which estimators are associated with them so as to avoid bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured nature of the process, and the documentation of rationale, help to make this technique more repeatable than the basic expert judgment approach. And, even if the final result is a wide range of values, the documented rationale provides support for the variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) Rule of Thumb Estimating\n",
    "\n",
    "Lot of different techniques here: For example, some techniques will involve making a size estimate of the software product, often in lines of code, then use a productivity factor like the average lines of code per week a programmer can produce to calculate effort and cost. Some techniques involve making an overall project estimate, say for total effort, and then use ratios to allocate how much effort is allocated to the various project phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential problem with rule-of-thumb techniques is that they may not scale up across different sizes and types of projects because the ratios and productivity factors can be different. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (4) Algorithmic Estimation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithmic estimating models involve using calculations or formulas that are typically based on estimates of software product size to provide estimates of effort, cost, or project schedule. Sometimes these models use very complex formulas, and sometimes they’re based on counts of software product attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to use some algorithmic models effectively historical data must be used to calibrate the models to organizational specifics, and some models require estimating or choosing a dozen or more parameters based on project and organizational characteristics. If historical is not available, the resulting estimates can be quite inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using these models is that they are quick and cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an algorithmic estimation model is the **Function Point Model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/07.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "A function point is an abstract measurement that expresses the amount of functionality a software product provides to its stakeholders. Function points are considered to be a measure of software size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basics behind the concept of function points is this. First, a product’s functional requirements are developed. Then, each requirement is categorized into one of five types: external inputs, external outputs, external inquiries, external interfaces, and internal logical files. A requirement’s complexity is then evaluated and assigned a number of function points. The function point counts for all the requirements are then summed to arrive at an initial function point count for the product. Adjustments to the initial function point count might then be made based upon specific product characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final function point count can then be correlated with historical data…like the average number of hours to implement a function point…to come up with estimates of effort, cost, and schedule. Or…the function point count might be plugged into another model, like the COCOMO model, to come up with the estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the **COCOMO II** Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/08.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "COCOMO stands for Constructive Cost Model. COCOMO has been around for decades, and is constantly being refined to improve accuracy and applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "COCOMO II consists of four sub-models that are based on the type of project and the point in the project life cycle that the estimating takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Application-Composition Model is used for estimating on prototyping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Early Design Model is used to for estimating once an initial set of requirements for the project has been established.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Post-Architectural Model is the most detailed model, and is used once the design architecture has been established.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reuse Model is used on projects that involve reusable software components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/09.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the formulas for the COCOMO II Early Design Model are shown here. In the COCOMO II model, the nominal effort, in units of person-months, is estimated based upon some size estimate for the software product, in thousands of lines of source code, raised to some power, B. \n",
    "\n",
    "B is a parameter that is based on five product and process characteristics, and its value ranges from 1.1 to 1.24. \n",
    "\n",
    "To refine the effort estimate, the nominal effort can be adjusted by a multiplier based on seven project and process attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimate of project duration, in calendar-months, can then be made using the duration formula. And…not shown here…the duration estimate can be adjusted, if necessary, with a multiplier that reflects a project compression or expansion factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this estimating approach is that it is fast and cheap. The challenges are that organizations must usually adjust the estimates for specific internal characteristics, and the estimates are all based on a size estimate…which can be difficult and may not be very accurate in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (5) Activity Based Estimation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/10.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another estimation technique is called activity-based estimation. This technique starts with what’s called a work-breakdown structure. A work-breakdown structure is a list of all the tasks that are needed to complete the project. They can be defined at a high level or at a very detailed level. Once the work tasks are identified, the effort associated with each task usually measured in person-hours, person-days, person-weeks, or person-months is estimated, along with the costs which are primarily labor costs. Non-labor costs also need to be estimated in order to come up with a total project cost estimate. The next step is to analyze the dependencies between tasks. Some tasks can be done in parallel, and some must be done sequentially so these dependencies help to determine the sequencing of all project tasks. Finally, the tasks, the dependencies, and the effort estimates, along with the staff resources that are expected to be committed to the project are all combined to estimate the project schedule. In practice, it is common to use project planning software tools to assist with these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity-based estimating has been shown to be the most accurate way of estimating in practice. And…it may be required for projects that involve contracts. It’s primary disadvantage is that for very large projects it can be quite time-consuming, even with assistance from project management tools. In practice, very large projects are often decomposed into smaller sub-projects to control complexity. \n",

    "\n",
    "Here we develop a WBS (Work breakdown structure) - which is a list that breaks down all the work to be performed on a project. Each part of a project may have a different work breakdown structure, and each different group that collaborates on the project may have their own work breakdown structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the requirements analysts will have a work breakdown structure, the developers will have one, the testers will have one, and so forth. The work breakdown structures may all be developed by the project manager, or may be developed by various groups and then coordinated through the project manager, depending upon the practices in a given organization\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod031/12.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a work breakdown template for a simple software development project. Note that the work breakdown structure is hierarchical. The first level has a component for each phase in the project life cycle. The second level breaks the work in each phase into major tasks. Only the tasks for the definition phase second level are shown in this example.\n",

    "As an example of task refinement, this illustration shows a further breakdown of the sub-tasks required to perform the interviews and analyze the existing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s important to remember is that any task that consumes effort…meaning time that will be spent on something…should be included in the project work breakdown structure so that it can be estimated and budgeted. For example, there should be at least one component for, say, weekly progress meetings…that’s an often-overlooked task. Other types of meetings such as customer meetings and reviews also need to be included and are often overlooked as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, for some parts of the project we may need to perform rework…so that should either appear as a task somewhere, so that its effort can be estimated and not forgotten. Rework consumes a very significant part of the total effort for a project…about 50 percent…so if it isn’t accounted for the project cost and schedule will not be realistic\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the deeper the work breakdown structure the more likely it is not to forget pieces of work that need to be done to successfully complete a project."
