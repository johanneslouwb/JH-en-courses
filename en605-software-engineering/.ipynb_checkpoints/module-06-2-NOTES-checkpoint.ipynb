    "# 6F: Using Decision Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll discuss how to use decision tables to document business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from earlier that functional requirements have business rules associated with them. Business rules typically specify how to take a function’s inputs and convert them to the function’s output\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a set of business rules for a functional requirement. The system requirement is to process an invoice. Depending upon the amount of the invoice and the customer’s account status, the invoice will be processed and a confirmation email will be sent, the invoice will be processed with a payment reminder and a confirmation email will be sent, or the invoice will not be processed and an email will be sent to the customer explaining why.\n",
    "\n",
    "These business rules are expressed in narrative form, which is the most common form used in practice. Expressing business rules using narrative is fine for simple rules, but the more complicated the rules get, the higher the risk that the rules will be documented incorrectly or interpreted incorrectly. **A better technique for documenting complex business rules is to use a decision table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by recalling the functional requirement model introduced in an earlier lecture. Remember; a functional requirement can have up to five parts. When using a decision table to express a requirement’s business rules, we typically start by identifying the requirement’s inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/02.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In our sample business rules there are two input variables; the amount of an invoice and a customer’s account status. Different decisions take place depending upon whether the invoice amount is up to \\\\$500 or greater than \\\\$500… so we’ll identify two conditions for that input variable as illustrated here. Similarly, there are two conditions for a customer’s account status: the status is okay if there are no invoices outstanding for less than 60 days, and the status is overdue if there are any invoices outstanding for 60 days or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five distinct outputs: send confirmation email, process invoice, write reminder notice on invoice, don’t process invoice, and send a confirmation pending email. Depending upon various combinations of the inputs, different outputs will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve identified the inputs and outputs, we’re ready to construct a decision table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we’ll do in constructing our decision table is to set up a row for each input condition and each output condition…like this. The inputs are shown in yellow and the outputs are shown in blue. So, our table has nine rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we generate the different combinations of inputs that are possible. I’ve marked them with Ys. For example, the first column represents an invoice amount up to \\\\$500 and an account status of OK. The last column represents an invoice amount greater than $500 and an account status of overdue\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "And then…for each set of inputs, we indicate which of the outputs will occur, by marking the appropriate cells with Xs…as illustrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/05.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "We read the decision table from top to bottom…with each column representing one possibility. For example, the second column indicates that if the amount of an invoice is up to \\\\$500 and the account status is overdue, a confirmation email will be sent, and the invoice will be processed with a reminder notice added to the invoice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…the benefit of using a decision table is that it is precise. The likelihood of misinterpreting the business rules should be zero…much lower than when the rules are expressed using narrative.\n",

    "# 6G: Using State Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we’ll discuss how to use state models to document how state changes occur in a product or product component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some types of applications are often state-full - and by state-full I mean that an application goes through a series of state changes over the course of processing time. Simply put; a state is a set of conditions at some point in time - and those conditions can change over the course of time based upon things that occur. Let’s take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were defining requirements for a system that would track the processing of ships at a commercial port. A ship would have state-full behavior, and it would be important for us to identify, document, and model that state-fullness for that type of application. For example, a ship could be at sea…meaning it hasn’t arrived at the port yet. This could be important to know, since it could be used to estimate a ship’s arrival time. Once a ship arrives at a port, it typically drops anchor near the official port entry point in an area known as an anchorage. It waits at the anchorage until it is given a berth assignment and a time it can leave the anchorage. When it departs the anchorage, it takes some time to reach its berth…the ship is said to be steaming to berth. While it’s at the berth it is being processed…meaning that cargo is being loaded and/or unloaded. It then gets a departure time assigned to it, and it steams from the berth, past the port entry point, and returns to its at-sea state. By the way, this is a real example, but I’ve simplified the states for discussion purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The states a ship is in, and the changes between those states, are illustrated in this little diagram. The clouds represent the states a ship can be in, and the arrows indicate the state changes…or state  transitions…associated with a ship. The states and transitions provide very important information. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/06.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitions are important because they define the allowable state changes. If a ship is currently in one state, its next state is very specific…for example, if a ship is at anchorage its next state must be steaming to berth…it couldn’t be steaming from berth. The states are important because certain processing functions are dependent upon specific states. For example, a ship must be at berth in order for cranes to be assigned to unload its cargo. Cranes can’t be assigned if a ship is at sea or steaming from berth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way of documenting states and transitions is to use something called a state model…so let’s see how that’s done:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/07.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a state model for a microprocessor-based HVAC system in a smart home. When it’s turned on, the system will automatically control the heading and air conditioning. The ovals represent states the system can be in, and the arrows represent state changes…or transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…this model represents the HVAC system when it’s in its on state. That is, the system is turned on, and the thermostat is monitoring the temperature in a particular area. If the system is turned off…it does nothing. Now I could have shown an off state but I didn’t for simplicity. Events can happen that can cause state transitions to take place. Events can be external to the system…like someone pressing an on/off switch…or an event can be internal to the system. In this example, most events will be internal, and will have to do with comparisons of a desired temperature setting and the actual temperature sensed by the thermostat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me walk you through the state model. When the system is turned on, the IDLE state is the initial state of the system. In the IDLE state, the thermostat is monitoring the temperature. If it gets a signal that it is too warm in the room, it will turn on the air conditioning. That is reflected in this model by making a transition from the IDLE to the cooling state. It remains in the cooling state until the room cools down to the desired temperature. This is reflected in the arrow on the left that begins and ends in the COOLING state…this is called a reflexsive or self transition. When the room reaches the desired temperature, a fan is turned on to blow the cool air around. This is reflected by the FANNING state. If the desired temperature is maintained, it will remain in the FANNING state for a certain period of time, after which the fan will be turned off (to save energy) and the system will be returned to the IDLE state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in the IDLE state, if the room becomes too cool, the heater may be turned on, and the specified set of state changes illustrated on the right side of the diagram will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn’t go through all the possibilities in this walk through, but hopefully you get the idea. Now, this state model is a lot more complicated than in the earlier ship example...but it’s very realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m sure you noticed the expressions in the square brackets. They’re called guard conditions…and they’ve been used here to provide more specifics about the conditions under which state transitions can take place. Guard conditions are boolean expressions. If a guard condition is true, a state change can take place. If it is false, the state change cannot take place. I’ll walk through one of the guard conditions for the FANNING state. It states that a transition to the IDLE state will take place if the desired temperature equals the actual temperature and the cumulative time the fan has been on is three minutes or longer. In other words, the fan will blow the air around as long as it is the desired temperature, but only for three minutes, before the IDLE state resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, the notation I’m using here is defined by the **Unified Modeling Language, or UML**. You’ll learn more about the UML as the course progresses. Also, there is a lot more involved in state modelling, but I think our discussion is more than sufficient for purposes of this  course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of model that is often used in conjunction with a state model, or in lieu of a state model, **is a state transition matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/08.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I’ve illustrated a state transition matrix for the HVAC system example. In this matrix there is a row for each state and a column for each event. The too cool even occurs when the desired temperature is greater than the actual temperature, the too warm event occurs when the desired temperature is less than the actual temperature, and the timeout event occurs if the bottom-most guard condition of the FANNING state is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll walk you through one or two rows of the table and you can see how it maps back to the state model. Let’s suppose the system is in the IDLE state and a TOO WARM event occurs. The table tells us that the system makes a transition to the COOLING state. If the system is in the COOLING state and a TOO WARM event occurs, it ignores the event…I used a big I to indicate that…and ignoring the event corresponds to the reflexive transition on the state model. If the system is in the COOLING state and a TIMEOUT event occurs…well that can’t happen, since a timeout can only occur when the system is in the FANNING state…so I use a blank cell to indicate that it can’t happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, I used events for the columns because I wanted to introduce the event concept. I could have used the guard conditions there instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "So…in summary…I hope you can see how state modeling can be a very useful activity for certain types of systems. In practice, some organizations defer state modeling to the design phase, but technically it can be considered to be a requirements activity. When we use an object- oriented approach to system development, state modeling is a common requirements analysis activity.\n",

    "# 6H: Data Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we’ll discuss how to use data models to establish data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Data Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/09.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data modeling involves building various kinds of models that describe the data that needs to be stored for a particular software product. There are three basic kinds of data models that are developed during the course of a software engineering project: a conceptual data model, a logical data model, and a physical data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **conceptual data model** describes things, called entities, that will be stored, and the relationships between those entities. For example, in a point of sale application for a retail store, information about sale transactions and customers would need to be stored…they would be entities. A relationship that exists between these two entities is that a customer can be associated with many sale transactions, but each sale transaction would be associated with a single customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **logical data model** elaborates on a conceptual data model by including attributes associated with the entities. In the point-of-sale example, attributes for a sale entity would be things like a sale transaction number, time and date of sale, total sale amount, and so forth. In practice, conceptual data modeling and logical data modeling are often done together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **physical data model** describes how the product’s database will actually be built. It would describe all the data tables, including column names, data types, and so forth. This model would typically be developed during the design phase of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptual and logical data models are independent of the particular database software product that will be used. The physical data model will usually be specific to a given database software product, since different database products may use different data types. In this lecture, I’m going to focus on conceptual and logical data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a data model?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/10.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "So…what’s a data model? A data model is an organized representation of business data that will need to be stored and managed. There are a number of different kinds of data models used on software projects…as I mentioned earlier…but we’re going to stick to the conceptual and logical data models that are often constructed as part of the requirements phase in a project. I’m going to use the term logical data model in this discussion…since building a conceptual model is a step in the logical data modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see a sample data model here. It’s not important to understand how to interpret it yet…we’ll get there soon. This data model illustrates some of the data types that will be stored an managed as part of a university course management system. Data about departments, courses, and students are illustrated here…as well as the associations or relationships between them. For brevity, I haven’t shown the specific data associated with departments, students, and so forth. Oh…by the way…this type of model is also called an entity relationship diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may be wondering, what the purpose of a data model is. It’s purpose is to discover and document data needs and data-related business rules more thoroughly...in other words, it’s used to help specify the data requirements for a software product. The data model will ultimately be used to design and implement efficient data stores for the application under development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using a data model is that it provides more precise, detailed, and unambiguous information about the data that will need to be stored and managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Modeling Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/11.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data modeling is often an iterative process that starts during the requirements elicitation activity. As needs are elicited, we discover the types of data that will need to be managed and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this data entity types. An entity type is a named class of entities which have the same set of descriptive attribute types. As an example, an entity type might be Employee. It will be used to model information that must be stored and managed about individual employees. All employees would have the same set of descriptive attributes, like name address, employee number, hire date…and so on. Each individual employee is called an employee instance. Ultimately, the data for entity types will likely be stored in relational database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then study the associations or relationships that some of these entity types will have with respect to each other. For example, students will enroll in one or more courses. A student may be associated with a single student account. A university department will offer courses in multiple subjects, and so forth. Technically, a model that shows the entity types and their relationships is called a conceptual data model, as I mentioned earlier in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity types must have attributes. Attributes correspond to information that will be stored and managed. For example a person entity type will have a name, a social security number, and lots of other descriptive information that will need to be managed. Attributes typically become fields in a relational database table. When attributes are added to the conceptual model it’s technically called a logical data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another step in data modeling, that is usually performed in the later stages, is to “normalize” the logical data model. Normalization involves organizing the data in relational database tables so that the data is not redundant and can be efficiently managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the diagram illustrates, data modeling steps can repeat as more requirements information is elicited and refined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Associations\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/12.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Associations represent relationships that entity types have with one another. I’m showing four basic types of associations: 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-1 conditional, and 1-to-many conditional. The diagramming notation for each of these associations is illustrated here, using what’s called the crows-foot notation. There are other notations as well that are used in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **1-to-1 association**, one instance of entity type A is associated with one instance of entity type B. For example, a person is associated with a single driver’s license.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **1-to-many association**, one instance of entity type A is associated with one or more instances of entity type B. For example, a customer could be associated with several sale transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **1-to-1 conditional association**, one instance of entity type A is associated with zero or one instances of entity type B. For example, a person may have zero or one spouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, in a **1-to-many conditional association**, one instance of entity type A is associated with zero or more instances of entity type B. For example, a policy holder may have filed zero or more claims on an insurance policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more types of associations than I’m illustrating here, but most of them are formed from these basic four.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/13.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also have more than one type of association between entity types, as illustrated here between a passenger and a ticket. By the way, in practice we almost always include an association name like in this example, and the association name is a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some associations are mutually exclusive. For example, due to regulations, an aircraft might carry only cargo or passengers. I’ve used a little arc in this diagram to indicate the mutual exclusive nature of those associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/14.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some entity types have bi-directional associations as illustrated here. When the entity relationship diagram is annotated to show this, there are some conventions that are useful to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entities are laid out left to right, we read that portion of the diagram from left to right, and the association name corresponding to the left-side entity is placed above the connecting link, and the name corresponding to the right-side entity is placed below the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entities are laid out vertically, we read that portion of the diagram top to bottom, with the association name for the top entity placed to the left of the link and the one for the bottom entity placed to the right of the link.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, data modelers will only include the left or top association name if the other name is self evident.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading the data model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/15.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a crack at reading this data model. Starting with the department entity…it says that a department offers several courses, but each course is offered by a single department. A student instance enrolls in multiple courses, and a course instance registers multiple students. A course is either an online course or an in-person course. The dot on the diagram is another notation for showing an “or” condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/16.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are characteristics of entities that provide descriptive detail about them. When they are shown on a data model they are placed in a compartment below the entity name, as illustrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic kinds of attributes…descriptors and identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **descriptor attribute** specifies a non-unique characteristic of an entity instance. In this diagram, a student’s major would be an example of a descriptor attribute, since many students can have the same major.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **identifier attribute**…also called a key…is used to uniquely identify an entity instance. Course number and department number are examples of identifier attributes in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### UML Notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/17.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, I’ve been using what’s called crows foot notation in the diagram examples. The Unified Modeling Language, UML, can also be used to describe data models. I’m showing the crows foot notation for the basic relationships on the left, and the equivalent UML representation on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple relationship using both the crows foot and the UML notation. There are more notations than these two that are used in practice…examples are the Chen notation and Bachman notation…but showing just these two different notations will suffice for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/18.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this lecture I’ll continue to use the crows foot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/19.png\" width=350>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data normalization is a technique that is used to organize data into tables. Normalization is very important when using relational database systems. It is used as part of logical data modeling for applications that fall into the category of online transactional processing (OLTP)…in which data modifications like inserts, deletes, and updates occur frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you normalize a database, you have four goals: arranging data into logical groupings such that each group describes a small part of the whole; minimizing the amount of duplicate data stored in a database; organizing the data such that, when you modify it, you make the change in only one place; and building a database in which you can access and manipulate the data quickly and efficiently without compromising the integrity of the data in storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is accomplished by defining a number of relatively simple data tables, and using primary and foreign keys as attributes in the tables to link related information together.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data modelers discuss normalization, they will often talk about the five normal forms. In this lecture, we’ll talk about un-normalized data and the first three normal forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/20.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with data that is un-normalized. Suppose\n",
    "part of the application we are building will require\n",
    "generating reports about different skill sets and levels\n",
    "of experience the employees in an organization have.\n",
    "And, let’s suppose the Employee entity illustrated here\n",
    "has been identified during the logical data modeling\n",
    "activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For brevity, only a few essential employee attributes\n",
    "are shown here…just enough to focus our discussion on\n",
    "normalization. An Employee entity will have attributes\n",
    "like employee number, employee name, salary, a job\n",
    "category, a list of codes representing various job skills\n",
    "an employee has, and a list of skill levels for each skill, measured in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how the Employee entity data may need to\n",
    "be stored in terms of records of information. Because\n",
    "there can be several skillCode/skillLevel pairs for a\n",
    "single employee, we have what’s called repeating\n",
    "groups…as illustrated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that has repeating groups is not normalized…and\n",
    "can’t be handled in relational database systems. Let’s\n",
    "see how this data might be normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/21.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before demonstrating how data can be normalized, it’s\n",
    "important to understand the concept of functional\n",
    "dependence. Functional dependence is a very simple\n",
    "concept. If some element B is functionally dependent\n",
    "on an element A, that means that if we know the value\n",
    "of A we can find the value of B that is associated with\n",
    "A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the data from the last example. There are a\n",
    "number of functional dependencies in this example.\n",
    "Employee name is functionally dependent on\n",
    "employee number because given an employee number\n",
    "there is a unique value of employee name. Note that\n",
    "the dependency is not true in the reverse direction.\n",
    "There can be several Jane Doe’s in a database, but each\n",
    "would have a unique employee number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee salary is also functionally dependent on\n",
    "employee number, as is the job category.\n",
    "And… skill level is functionally dependent upon both\n",
    "the employee number and skill code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…let’s talk about normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/22.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that is in first normal form has no repeating\n",
    "groups. The data can be stored as a simple two-\n",
    "dimensional table.\n",
    "To put the data from that last example into first normal\n",
    "form, we’d break it up into two tables as illustrated\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first table will contain the employee number,\n",
    "employee name, employee salary and job\n",
    "category…and the employee number will be used as a\n",
    "primary key. That means it can be used to uniquely find\n",
    "the employee name, salary, and job category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second table will contain employee number, skill\n",
    "code, and skill level. It will contain a concatenated key\n",
    "consisting of employee number and skill code. We must\n",
    "know an employee number and a skill code to find the\n",
    "skill level for a specific employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data model, modified to show the\n",
    "normalization, looks like this . The underlined attributes\n",
    "indicate they are keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/23.png\" width=450>\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lecture we’ll discuss how business process\n",
    "modeling fits into the requirements definition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business processes make up the heart of how an\n",
    "organization works. Business processes often evolve in\n",
    "an unstructured way and can become complex, hard to\n",
    "manage, and inefficient. When we develop software\n",
    "products to support an organization’s processes, it’s\n",
    "important to understand how those processes work.\n",
    "Development of new products often change an\n",
    "organization’s processes and can also impact\n",
    "organizational entities in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the requirements definition activity in a\n",
    "software engineering project, it’s often necessary to\n",
    "study existing business processes and evaluate the\n",
    "impact a new or modified software product will have\n",
    "on those processes. An excellent way to study these\n",
    "processes is by building process models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process models can help us discover how certain areas\n",
    "of a business currently work, how a proposed software\n",
    "product will impact existing operations, and can also\n",
    "help us to discover additional stakeholders, problem\n",
    "areas, and business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/25.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of process models used in\n",
    "practice today. I’m going to discuss a few of\n",
    "them…those that are listed here. My purpose in this\n",
    "lecture is to expose you to commonly used modeling\n",
    "tools…not to teach you the details of how to use these\n",
    "modeling tools…though most of them are pretty\n",
    "simple…so this is more of a “what” lecture than a “how\n",
    "to” lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more business process models, and more\n",
    "modeling notations, than I will cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/26.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of business process model that I’ll talk\n",
    "about is the process hierarchy diagram. This is\n",
    "sometimes called a process decomposition diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the hierarchy is one function of a\n",
    "business…in this case a warehousing function. A\n",
    "business function is defined as a group of business\n",
    "activities which together completely support one\n",
    "aspect of furthering the mission of an enterprise. The\n",
    "names of business functions are usually nouns…such as\n",
    "marketing, financial planning, or engineering. During\n",
    "the requirements phase of a project we would identify\n",
    "business functions that may be impacted by our\n",
    "project. Sometimes it is clear which business functions\n",
    "will be impacted…and sometimes it’s not so\n",
    "clear…which is why it’s important to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchy diagram starts with a business function\n",
    "and decomposes it into lower-level processes until the\n",
    "decomposition results in what’s called elementary or\n",
    "primitive processes. An elementary process is the\n",
    "smallest unit of activity that would have meaning to an\n",
    "end user or stakeholder…basically it means that we\n",
    "can’t break down a process any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagram, I’m showing three processes associated\n",
    "with the warehousing function…fulfill orders, receive\n",
    "stock, and control inventory. There could be many\n",
    "other processes as well. The ellipsis…three dots…in the\n",
    "fulfill orders and control inventory portions of the\n",
    "diagram indicate that these could be further\n",
    "decomposed. Names of processes typically consist of\n",
    "an active verb and object…for example…allocate\n",
    "payment, calculate taxes, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve illustrated further decomposing the receive stock\n",
    "process into lower-level processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the same information, but in a slightly different\n",
    "visual presentation. Now, as you can see, the process\n",
    "hierarchy diagram shows the business processes\n",
    "associated with a business function. I’m only showing a\n",
    "few levels of decomposition here. In practice, there\n",
    "could be many levels. It depends on each individual\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/27.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a process hierarchy diagram is to\n",
    "visually communicate some or all of an organization’s\n",
    "functions. It helps analysts to identify and\n",
    "communicate the scope of a project, and it also helps\n",
    "analysts to identify additional project stakeholders.\n",
    "What this diagram doesn’t show, however, are the\n",
    "dependencies between the various processes. For that,\n",
    "we need another diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/28.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "The process dependency diagram illustrates the\n",
    "dependencies between various processes.\n",
    "Dependencies mean that certain processes must\n",
    "precede other processes, and some must be completed\n",
    "in a particular order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this process dependency diagram I’m illustrating the\n",
    "dependencies associated with the Receive Stock\n",
    "process. Arrows are used to depict the dependencies.\n",
    "The diagram is very simple to follow. The receive\n",
    "shipment process involves receiving a delivery of items\n",
    "from a supplier. The output of the process represents\n",
    "the items that are received. The items are then\n",
    "inspected for damage. Some items may be rejected, in\n",
    "which case a return authorization is requested and the\n",
    "items are subsequently returned to the supplier. The\n",
    "accepted items are stored in inventory, inventory\n",
    "control information is updated, and the supplier is paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a process dependency diagram is to\n",
    "help understand which steps in a process are\n",
    "dependent on others. It can help to identify processes\n",
    "that may need to be changed or are otherwise\n",
    "impacted by a project. It can also be used to identify\n",
    "problems and bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/29.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common tool for modeling business processes\n",
    "is the UML Activity Diagram. This activity diagram\n",
    "shows the dependencies between activities in a\n",
    "business process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The activities are represented by rectangles. Activities\n",
    "can represent an entire business process or a step in a\n",
    "business process. Activities should have arrows going in\n",
    "and out, unless the activity is a start or end activity. The\n",
    "arrows are called transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the diagram, a special symbol is used to\n",
    "represent the start of a process. The first step in the\n",
    "process is to receive an order. The first horizontal bar\n",
    "represents what is called a fork. A fork indicates that\n",
    "several activities will occur in parallel. Forks have one entry transition and multiple exit transitions.\n",
    "A fill order activity takes place along the left-hand side.\n",
    "The order is sent via overnight delivery or regular\n",
    "delivery. At the same time, the customer is invoiced,\n",
    "and payment is ultimately received.\n",
    "\n",
    "When all the parallel activities are completed, the order\n",
    "can be closed. The second horizontal bar represents a\n",
    "join. A join has multiple input transitions and one exit\n",
    "transition. All the activities above the join must be\n",
    "completed before the exit transition can take place.\n",
    "A special symbol is used to designate the end of the\n",
    "process. A process will have one start node, but it may\n",
    "have several end nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at the left-hand activities. Branching\n",
    "occurs based on the type of shipping the customer has\n",
    "chosen for the order. The first diamond symbol is called\n",
    "a branch symbol. Nothing gets annotated inside the\n",
    "diamond. There is something called a guard…or guard\n",
    "condition…associated with the left-hand transition\n",
    "from the branch. Guard conditions are boolean\n",
    "expressions. If a guard condition is true, its transition\n",
    "will be taken. If guard conditions are used, they must\n",
    "form a complete set…meaning each outgoing transition\n",
    "must have a guard. It’s okay to use \\[else\\] or \\[otherwise\\]\n",
    "to indicate fall-through logic. Each branch must have a\n",
    "merge, which is also indicated with a diamond.\n",
    "\n",

    "A swim lane diagram is another common tool to model\n",
    "business processes. A swim lane diagram is used to\n",
    "illustrate which business area is responsible for the\n",
    "activities associated with a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram illustrated here represents the same\n",
    "process as in the last example, but the “swim lanes”\n",
    "make it very clear which business area is responsible\n",
    "for performing each activity. In this example, I’ve used\n",
    "the activity diagram notation, but virtually any\n",
    "flowcharting notation could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/31.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "A context diagram is a tool for visually describing the\n",
    "scope of a system. The circle, or bubble, represents the\n",
    "entire system under study. The rectangles are called\n",
    "external entities. They can represent system users,\n",
    "other systems, and other organizations that are\n",
    "external to the system under study. The arrows indicate\n",
    "the key data that flows across the system boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I already mentioned, a context diagram provides a\n",
    "visual description of the system scope. It can also help\n",
    "to identify additional stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod062/32.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another type of process model is a data flow\n",
    "diagram. It shows how information flows through a\n",
    "system and the process dependencies as well. Data\n",
    "flow diagrams originated as part of the structured\n",
    "systems analysis methodologies…and there are several\n",
    "notational styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data flow diagrams usually start with a context\n",
    "diagram, and are then decomposed until they reach the\n",
    "level of elementary processes…so they can show\n",
    "process hierarchy as well as process dependency. There\n",
    "are also a set of rules associated with data flow\n",
    "diagrams that are used to ensure consistency and\n",
    "correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I’m starting with a context diagram for\n",
    "a sales processing system. The entire system is shown\n",
    "as a single bubble. I then decomposed the context\n",
    "diagram into a first-level data flow diagram. Note that\n",
    "there are two processes shown at this level…a sales\n",
    "fulfillment process and a sales commission process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the three data flows from the context\n",
    "diagrams…phone in order, customer order, and\n",
    "commission check…appear on the first-level diagram.\n",
    "This is one of the rules…and it’s called data flow\n",
    "“balancing” or “levelling”. Net data flows for a child\n",
    "data flow diagram and its parents must be the same,\n",
    "except for file accesses and trivial error handling.\n",

    "A type of diagram that is often used in conjunction with\n",
    "both process modeling and data modeling is the CRUD\n",
    "matrix. CRUD stands for create, read, update, and\n",
    "delete…and it can be used to map data permissions\n",

    "will be very helpful to the system designers, and can\n",
    "also be used to help verify correctness and completeness of the use cases. For example, note that\n",
    "there is no customer delete capability in any of the use\n",
    "cases indicated in the matrix. This could indicate several\n",
    "things: one…a delete capability is not required,\n",
