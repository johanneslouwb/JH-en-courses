    "So...what is software testing anyway?\n",
    "Simply put, software testing is the activity of evaluating a software\n",
    "item to detect the differences between the item‘s required\n",
    "response and its actual response for a given set of input conditions.\n",
    "Now, there‘s more to software testing from a project perspective\n",
    "than is covered in this definition. The overall process of software\n",
    "testing consists of numerous activities such as test planning, test\n",
    "design, test execution, and so forth, that we‘ll talk more in detail\n",
    "about later.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/02.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "I like this definition of testing because it describes what it means to\n",
    "test into more of an engineering framework, which I illustrate here.\n",
    "And...it also maps nicely into what needs to be documented as part\n",
    "of each test applied to the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue box is the software item being tested. The item can be an\n",
    "entire system, a subsystem, or a very atomic component like a\n",
    "function or subroutine. The item under test will take certain inputs,\n",
    "and, if the item has been implemented correctly and completely it\n",
    "should provide certain outputs or responses to the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we test the item, we create a set of test inputs, apply them\n",
    "to the item...usually by executing it...and observe an actual\n",
    "response. The actual response is then compared to the required or\n",
    "expected response. If the responses match, that‘s good. If the\n",
    "responses don‘t match, that‘s an indication that something may be\n",
    "wrong with the item.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes testers talk about the scope of a test. The scope of a\n",
    "test is the collection of underlying software components that will be\n",
    "tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional software testing, the scope could be a unit of code\n",
    "tested in isolation, a group of units, or the entire software product.\n",
    "When object-oriented software is tested, the scope could be a\n",
    "class, one or more methods in a class, a group of classes, or the\n",
    "entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of testing that‘s being performed, and who is doing the\n",
    "testing, typically determines the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "When most software engineers think about the activity of testing\n",
    "they usually think in terms of executing the software, as was\n",
    "illustrated in my earlier diagram. That‘s the most common type of\n",
    "testing activity...and we refer to it as dynamic testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there‘s also another type of testing activity, called static testing,\n",
    "that is often performed both on software components and certain\n",
    "work products. This form of testing doesn‘t execute any code. The\n",
    "most common form of static testing is some time of review...like a\n",
    "code walkthrough or code inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/05.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "When I review client test efforts, I like to categorize tests into those\n",
    "that are fault-directed and those that are conformance-directed.\n",
    "Fault-directed tests are designed to try and expose faults in the\n",
    "item under test. For example, a test may include invalid data types\n",
    "or ranges. Conformance directed tests are designed to demonstrate\n",
    "that the item under test satisfies its requirements. For example, a\n",
    "test of a web-based shopping cart product might involve selecting\n",
    "several items for purchase to verify that the total purchase amount\n",
    "and any applicable discounts are correctly calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good test effort will consist of both categories of tests. A poor\n",
    "test effort might focus mostly on conformance-directed tests.\n",

    "I‘ve been using the term test all through this lecture, but I‘ve yet to\n",
    "define it. A test is a specific set of input data, events and\n",
    "interactions, and associated expected results, that is applied to the\n",
    "item under test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data associated with a test can be a single set of data\n",
    "associated with a simple transaction...like entering three integers\n",
    "that are supposed to represent the sides of a triangle...or...it could\n",
    "represent a a set of transaction data, like a month‘s worth of debit\n",
    "and credit data for an accounting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "I generally prefer to use the term test case rather than\n",
    "test...because the term implies something more specific. For\n",
    "example, when testing an application that determines triangle\n",
    "types...I may have one test case to test for each type of\n",
    "triangle...and the data for each test case would vary. When I test an\n",
    "accounting system, I might have a month‘s worth of debit and\n",
    "credit data, and use that same data to test different accounting\n",
    "functions. The test of each different function would consist of at\n",
    "least one test case.\n",

    "A test set is a collection of one or more test cases applied to the\n",

    "for similar types of responses...for example, I may have a test set\n",
    "that has five test cases used to test error-handling in the item under\n",
    "test, and a test set of three test cases to test performance issues,\n",

    "average number of test cases that people come up with\n",
    "is between five and seven. I come up with a lot more.\n",
    "Now…I’ve grouped my test cases into test sets in order\n",
    "to illustrate the concept of the test set. Not everybody\n",
    "uses the idea of a test set, but I have found it to be very\n",
    "helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first test set consists of tests associated with valid\n",
    "triangles of each type…so, I’ll have three test cases. The\n",
    "second test set consists of test cases that will have\n",
    "invalid input data. Each bullet here consists of one or\n",
    "more test cases. I’ll have one or more test cases for non-\n",
    "integer types…maybe a test case that has floating point numbers, a test case that has alphabetic values, and a\n",
    "test case that uses various symbols. I’ll also have at least\n",
    "one test case with mixed data types…and so forth. The\n",
    "last two items will depend somewhat on the user\n",
    "interface…so they may change or be eliminated as a\n",
    "function of that…but I want to include them in my\n",
    "planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/11.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three more test sets. Again…each bullet\n",
    "corresponds to at least one test case.\n",
    "Test set three is a very powerful one…because any three\n",
    "sides does not a triangle make. There’s a rule in\n",
    "mathematics that says for three sides to form a valid\n",
    "triangle, the sum of any two sides must be strictly\n",
    "greater than the third side. So…if I used values 1, 2, and\n",
    "3, they would not make a valid triangle. Similarly, values\n",
    "in which the sum of any two sides is less than the third\n",
    "would also make an invalid triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d also test for extremely large numbers. For\n",
    "example…an equilateral triangle with side values of\n",
    "999,999. Depending on the computing platform,\n",
    "programming language, and coding decisions that were\n",
    "made for the software product…the largest integer value\n",
    "that could be handled might be smaller than these\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "And…I’d also probably test for different permutations of\n",
    "the equal sides for isosceles triangles. So…as you can see…I come up with a lot more than 5-7\n",

    "### Black Box Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/12.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…the type of testing we just did is called black box\n",
    "testing. Black box testing is an approach or strategy that\n",
    "focuses on designing test cases based on the\n",
    "requirements for a product. The code isn’t used in the\n",
    "design of the tests…in fact, the code may not yet even\n",
    "be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three key drivers to how effective a black box\n",
    "testing effort will be: the test design techniques used,\n",
    "the quality of the requirements, and the level of subject\n",
    "matter expertise there is on the test design team.\n",
    "In the exercise, I used the concept of test sets in\n",
    "conjunction with a test design technique in which I\n",
    "started with conformance-directed tests, then fault-\n",
    "directed tests. The fault-directed tests were organized\n",
    "into invalid data, business rules, and extreme point tests.\n",
    "This is what helped me to define such a rich set of test\n",
    "cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the requirements in the first place is\n",
    "another driver that impacts the potential quality of the\n",
    "test effort. The requirements were incomplete. They\n",
    "didn’t specify any upper bounds on the side values, and\n",
    "a critical business rule was missing…so there’s a risk that\n",
    "testers may miss some very important tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my seminars, I always ask participants if testers should\n",
    "be expected to know the business rules…in our example\n",
    "the business rules would be that the sum of any two\n",
    "sides is strictly greater than the third. Participant\n",
    "responses to this question vary quite a bit. Then I ask\n",
    "them to think about the testers who test the software in\n",
    "their organization and whether they have significant\n",
    "knowledge of the business rules. The response to this\n",
    "question is usually a lot narrower…the majority say no.\n",
    "Which brings us to the third driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third driver is the level of subject matter expertise\n",
    "on the part of the test designers. A high level of subject\n",
    "matter expertise would likely test the missing business\n",
    "rule…a low level of expertise would not.\n",
    "So…the combination of incomplete requirements and lack of subject matter expertise present a significant\n",
    "project risk when it comes to testing.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Common testing problems\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/13.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I’d like to wrap up this lecture by summarizing some\n",
    "common testing problems that organizations experience\n",
    "in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very common problem I see quite often is the lack\n",
    "of a systematic testing process. Testing is often ad hoc.\n",
    "When testers are challenged to defend how they came\n",
    "up with number of test cases and overall testing effort\n",
    "required to test a product, they often don’t have a\n",
    "reasonable response because they didn’t use a\n",
    "systematic method for estimating how many tests are\n",
    "required and why. One of the things it’s important to\n",
    "strive for is repeatability and defensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second problem that’s also quite prevalent is that\n",
    "testing activities often take place too late in the life\n",
    "cycle…and some testing efforts don’t get started until\n",
    "after the software is coded. That’s an expensive\n",
    "mistake…and it can lead to more rework than is\n",
    "necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve already talked about poor requirements in the\n",
    "context of that little exercise you did. Now, if we\n",
    "combine this with the scenario that we didn’t do that\n",
    "testing exercise until after the software was constructed,\n",
    "you can see the rework impact very clearly. If the\n",
    "business rule was missing from the requirement there’s\n",
    "an excellent chance it’s missing from the code.\n",
    "There’s another problem that I see a lot in organizations that have independent test groups. In those situations,\n",
    "it’s often unclear what responsibilities the developers\n",
    "should have for testing and what responsibilities the\n",
    "independent testers should have. The result is often a\n",
    "less thorough level of testing than there should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, is what I like to call data-first or\n",
    "bottom-up test case development. When I give that\n",
    "testing exercise in my in-person seminars, I often see\n",
    "participants start by writing down data values for the\n",
    "sides of a triangle. Some even try to sketch out what the\n",
    "code would look like. This is not the best way to design\n",
    "tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data should come last. It’s much more\n",
    "effective to estimate how many test cases we might\n",
    "need, and what types of test cases, and then come up\n",
    "with the data as a last step. Recall that I didn’t use a\n",
    "single data value in my sample exercise solution. My\n",
    "experience has shown that the bottom-up approach\n",
    "misses a lot of potentially powerful tests, and also can\n",
    "result in what I like to call the over-test, under-test\n",
    "syndrome. That means that a large number of tests may\n",
    "be generated, but many are redundant and don’t add\n",
    "any value.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a number of misconceptions about software testing in\n",
    "practice. One major misconception is that software testing can\n",
    "prove that a software product is free from defects. Testing is a\n",
    "defect detection activity...and just because a suite of tests runs\n",
    "successfully doesn‘t prove that a product is defect-free. Depending\n",
    "upon how the test suite is designed, such a result might give us a\n",
    "reasonable degree of confidence that we think the product is\n",
    "defect-free...but it does not suffice as a proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I talk to some practitioners about this, particularly managers,\n",
    "it often shatters some long-held beliefs.\n",
    "In practice, dynamic testing can only show the presence of\n",
    "defects...not their absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for dynamic testing to prove the correctness of\n",
    "a software product we would have to do exhaustive\n",
    "testing…basically, exposing the product to every\n",
    "sequence and combinations of input conditions that are\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the triangle exercise we did earlier, to\n",
    "prove through dynamic testing that the product always\n",
    "evaluates an equilateral triangle correctly, we would\n",
    "have to execute it using every valid triplet of equal\n",
    "numbers representing the values of the sides. If the\n",
    "product uses integers internally to represent the values\n",
    "of sides, and the product was coded using the Java\n",
    "language, then there would be more than two billion\n",
    "tests required…since the range of valid positive values\n",
    "for an integer variable in Java is 1 to 2,147,483,647.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it took one second to run and evaluate each of those\n",
    "tests, the total time required would be more than\n",
    "596,523 hours…the equivalent of about 68 years…just to\n",
    "prove that one function. Hence, my use of the term\n",
    "“exhaustive” testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many execution paths?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/14.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than test every possible combination of program inputs,\n",
    "which is clearly infeasible, some practitioners feel that it is sufficient\n",
    "to run enough tests to ensure that every possible program\n",
    "execution path is exercise at least once under test...since different\n",
    "input data values can generally cause some of the same paths to be\n",
    "exercised. This also becomes exhaustive as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example...here‘s some pseudo-code for a verysimple\n",
    "function. For our purposes, it‘s not important to care about what\n",
    "the function does...it‘s just important to understand its structure.\n",
    "The code consists of one iteration construct that repeats 20\n",
    "times...and has 3 if-else constructs. Now...how many possible\n",
    "execution paths are there in this code? It‘s kind of hard to figure\n",
    "out by looking at the code. So, let‘s look a a flowchart instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/15.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‘s a flowchart version of the code. It‘s a lot easier to calculate\n",
    "the number of execution paths from it. For any iteration of the\n",
    "looping construct there are 4 possible paths that could be\n",
    "executed...and there are 20 iterations...so there are 4 to the 20th\n",
    "power possible execution paths. That‘s equivalent to just over 10 to\n",
    "the 12th power...or just over a trillion paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...whether we look at a products input domain or execution\n",
    "paths...exhaustive testing is not feasible in practice.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/16.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "I‘m going to pretty much just mention some basic testing principles\n",
    "here...and I‘ll elaborate on them in subsequent lectures.\n",
    "The first two principles are that testing activities should begin as\n",
    "early as the requirements phase, and that test plans should be\n",
    "driven by, and linked to, the product requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third principle states the components of a test case. This is very\n",
    "important, and I often see it violated in practice. Recall that triangle\n",
    "exercise that you did earlier. When I give that exercise in my in-\n",
    "person seminars, I often see people writing down test case data\n",
    "that corresponds to the input values for the sides of the triangle.\n",
    "But they usually fail to write down the expected result for each set\n",
    "of inputs...and that‘s not good. Expected results for each test case,\n",
    "and how the expected and actual results will be compared...which\n",
    "is what I mean by evaluation criteria...need to be mandatory\n",
    "components of a test case.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/17.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle number four states that a test case should be as\n",
    "repeatable as possible. This is important for tests that have to be\n",
    "re-run and for regression testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in practice, this may not always be able to be done, but it\n",
    "should be incorporated as much as possible. An example of kinds of\n",
    "tests that may not be able to be completely repeatable would be\n",
    "those that are run off of a database...may be a database of\n",
    "transactions that are being used to test a number of different\n",
    "functions. If transactions are added or deleted, the state of the\n",
    "database can change. This can be dealt with in some situations by\n",
    "either keeping a baseline repository or by having tests that undo\n",
    "what was done by other tests...but this may be difficult to do when\n",
    "the same database is being shared among several testers.\n",
    "Principle five is pretty obvious...keep a test repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/18.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle six involves regression testing. Now, in practice, it usually\n",
    "isn‘t necessary to completely re-run all tests whenever a change is\n",
    "made, particularly when testing at the system level. And...using a\n",
    "test traceability table, which you‘ll see an example of a bit later,\n",
    "and really help in determining what tests may need to be re-run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle seven is an important one. In practice, more defects are\n",
    "generally found during testing in projects where an independent\n",
    "test team participates. For smaller projects, and in some\n",
    "organizations where testing is more informal and the testing is\n",
    "done by developers, independent test teams may be difficult to\n",
    "apply. In those situations, it is extremely important that developers\n",
    "be trained in effective testing techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I already discussed principle eight, so I won‘t repeat myself here.\n",
    "Principle nine is also a very important one, particularly in\n",
    "environments where there have been historical problems with the\n",
    "quality of requirements. In that earlier triangle exercise, we saw\n",
    "that because the requirements were incomplete...missing an\n",

    "single phase approach to testing versus a life cycle\n",
    "phase approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most software project life cycles, there is a phase\n",
    "devoted to testing. The testing phase usually occurs\n",
    "later in the life cycle as illustrated here. For many\n",
    "projects, most of the testing activities may be\n",
    "performed in this single phase or step…and that can be\n",
    "problematic for reasons we’ve talked about earlier in\n",
    "the course, regarding error amplification and relative\n",
    "costs to find and fix problems. In this diagram, the\n",
    "dashed arrows represent typical feedback and error\n",

    "usually occurs during the testing phase…when test\n",
    "failures begin to indicate problems.\n",

    "If a waterfall life cycle model is used, defect detection\n",

    "The life cycle approach to testing is characterized by\n",
    "two primary things: Some type of testing is performed\n",
    "at each major phase of the software life cycle, and\n",
    "testing activities are performed essentially in parallel to\n",
    "development activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing may be static testing…which is accomplished by\n",
    "using the review or inspection models we discussed\n",
    "earlier in the course…or it could be dynamic\n",
    "testing…meaning that the software is exercised using\n",

    "Testing in parallel means that while the developers are\n",
    "developing, the testers are also working on activities\n",

    "\n",
    "Let me start with the requirements phase. Major\n",
    "testing issues that can be addressed at the\n",
    "requirements phase include requirements\n",
    "completeness, requirements testability, and\n",
    "requirements ambiguity. These issues are somewhat\n",
    "interrelated. For example, a requirement may\n",
    "untestable because it is ambiguous or incomplete.\n",
    "The type of testing that would be used at this point in\n",
    "a project would be static testing...namely conducting\n",
    "requirements walkthroughs or inspections. A tester‘s\n",
    "interest in those reviews would be to assure that the\n",

    "### Tester tasks - requirements phase\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/24.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of tester work products...there are typically no formal\n",
    "work products produced at this point in a project.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Design phase testing issues and techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/25.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During the design phase, the main design issues are\n",
    "typically correctness and completeness. From the\n",
    "designer viewpoint, these issues would apply to the\n",
    "software product design. From the tester viewpoint,\n",
    "these issues would be applied to the testing work\n",
    "products that are produced during the design phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of techniques, static testing...walkthroughs or\n",
    "inspections...would be performed on product design\n",
    "and testing work products. In addition, traceability and\n",
    "test design techniques can be used. Traceability can be\n",
    "applied to the test plan to ensure the plan adequately\n",
    "covers the requirements. Test design techniques can be\n",
    "used to design actual test cases.\n",

    "### Test Traceability matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/26.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of a test traceability matrix. Each\n",
    "row corresponds to a requirement. In this matrix, I’ve\n",
    "used a row for each use case and a row for each non-\n",
    "functional requirement. The columns of the matrix\n",
    "correspond to test sets. Recall that a test set consists of\n",
    "one or more test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, test set one will be used to test use\n",
    "case one, test sets one, two, and three will be used to\n",
    "test use case two…and so forth. If there are any blank\n",
    "rows, that would indicate that we haven’t designed any\n",
    "tests to test that use case or requirement…or, if we’re\n",
    "using an incremental life cycle model, it might indicate that requirement isn’t scheduled to be tested in the\n",
    "current development cycle. Of course, we’d have to\n",
    "ultimately look at the specific test cases in each test set\n",
    "to determine if the coverage is really adequate…so the\n",
    "matrix is really a first-level look.\n",

    "### Tester Tasks - Design phase\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/27.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‘s a list of typical tester tasks and deliverables during the\n",
    "design phase. Two deliverables that would be produced under the\n",
    "life cycle approach are a test plan and a test description\n",
    "document. Samples of these documents will be illustrated shortly.\n",
    "In terms of timing, a test plan would be scheduled for delivery\n",
    "about half way through the design phase, or at the end of\n",
    "preliminary design if a preliminary design phase is used. The test\n",
    "descriptions would be scheduled for delivery ideally by the end of\n",
    "the design phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where there is no independent test group, I like to\n",
    "recommend that the developers produce a test plan during this\n",
    "phase...before coding begins...as well as at least a partial test\n",
    "description deliverable. This recommendation is very consistent\n",
    "with the notion of test-driven development.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is an independent test team, I also recommend that\n",
    "the testers and the developers review the test plan. Whenever I\n",
    "have witnessed this in my client organizations...it has been a\n",
    "win/win situation...and the developers have often changed their\n",
    "detailed design approach due to increased insight obtained from\n",
    "seeing things from the test viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample test plan\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/28.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a sample test plan template. This is actually one\n",
    "that I helped to develop for several clients. Most of the\n",
    "sections are self-evident. Some of the information\n",
    "might not be applicable for smaller projects…but the\n",
    "contents are very scalable. This plan has been used on\n",
    "single person projects and projects with dozens of team\n",
    "members. In practice, each “bullet” can be\n",
    "implemented using a form or a table, so the document\n",
    "is easily assembled and can be light on narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me direct your attention to section five. In this test\n",
    "plan, testers identify test sets…not specific test cases.\n",
    "Recall the triangle program example from an earlier\n",
    "lecture. I identified a number of different test sets for\n",
    "testing that product, but I didn’t provide specific test\n",
    "case data. Recall that the description of each of the test\n",
    "sets was adequate enough for us to estimate how many\n",
    "test cases would actually be produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now…some test plans actually require that specific test\n",
    "cases be included…and that’s okay. I like the idea of the\n",
    "test set first, followed by test cases later, because the\n",
    "test plan can be drafted and evaluated earlier in the\n",
    "project life cycle since less effort is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample test description format\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/29.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides a test plan, a test description was another work\n",
    "product that I identified as being delivered by the end\n",
    "of the design phase. So…what exactly is a test\n",
    "description document? It’s a document that describes\n",
    "the individual test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template is from an old DOD standard. I first\n",
    "became familiar with it when I consulted with DOD\n",
    "contractors who had to implement processes to comply\n",
    "with the standard. I really liked this particular\n",
    "document. It starts with taking each test…what I’ve\n",
    "been calling a test set…and decomposing it into one or\n",
    "more test cases. For each test case, any initialization\n",
    "requirements, input data, and so forth must be\n",
    "documented. Recall that in the triangle testing\n",
    "example, my first test set contained three test\n",
    "cases…one for each valid triangle type. So…in this template…section 3.1 would describe those three test\n",
    "cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod13/30.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s another style for a test description document.\n",
    "This is another example of one I designed for a client.\n",
    "This one is more like a spreadsheet. You would have a\n",
    "spreadsheet, or document section, for each test set.\n",
    "As an example, for the triangle program, there would\n",
    "be a spreadsheet for the first test set, and since there\n",
    "were three test cases in that test set, three rows would\n",
    "be filled in to document the information for each test\n",
    "case.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in a project we’d still be in the design\n",
    "phase…but look at how much in the way of formal test\n",
    "activities can be done…and how much insight there\n",
    "would be into the quality of the testing process. If there\n",
