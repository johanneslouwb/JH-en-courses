    "What is a system anyways? There are many different definitions of a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/01.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is systems engineering? \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/02.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems engineering typically requires the **collaboration** of many different types of disciplines, such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, perhaps physics or other scientific disciplines, and also software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another characteristic of systems is that they contain components that work together to contribute to the system‘s overall functionality. These components are often called subsystems:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a real system example, let‘s take an automobile. The automobile itself is a system, with well-defined behavior. It consists of numerous subsystems, some of which are shown above. There‘s a powertrain system, a safety control system, a fuel control system, a brake control system etc. Each of the automobile‘s subsystems are designed to provide well-defined behavior that contributes to the overall functioning and behavior of the entire automobile. Some of these subsystems may be relatively independent, and some might be quite interdependent on other subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "When automobiles are designed, some of the decisions that are made in the systems engineering process is which subsystems will be responsible for various functions, which functions will be satisfied by hardware components, and which will be satisfied by software.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, before any software engineering takes place, **system responsibilities**, - or **requirements** - must be allocated to the software components that make up the system and subsystem elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‘s a piece of a systems engineering life cycle. The first two phases in this life cycle consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) system requirements analysis\n",
    "2) system design. \n",
    "\n",
    "System requirements analysis determines the requirements for the overall system. Some of these requirements will be fulfilled by hardware, some by software and some by both as an example, software may be embedded in firmware for certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/04.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "A step within these phases, sometimes called **functional analysis** or **functional allocation**, will allocate the system functionality to the system‘s hardware components and its software components. Then, the software engineering process begins - as indicated by the upper part of the diagram - as does the hardware engineering process - indicated in the lower portion of the diagram. Then, the hardware components are integrated, tested, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to take away from the above diagram is how software engineering fits into the systems engineering life cycle. Needless to say, there can be variations on the above schematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up next, we'll discuss some of the criteria that might be used to allocate system requirements to software.\n",

    "# Allocating Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you allocate requirements, you need to identify subsystems and components of the system. We'll focus on \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware**: can consist of computers, peripheral devices, storage devices, and  special devices such as sensors or measuring devices that could be responsible for sensing changes in environmental variables or reporting measurements. Some applications, like embedded applications, may also require firmware to perform certain functions.\n",
    "- **Software**: could also be decomposed into components such as application software, operating system software, and databases etc.\n",
    "- **People**: \n",
    "- **Processes**: could also be responsible for performing needed functionality, either by modifying existing processes or developing new business processes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Functional allocation / Functional analysis**: Once the subsystems and components have been identified, system functions must be allocated to them. In systems engineering this is called functional allocation or functional analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/05.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "How various functions are allocated is dependent upon each system and its associated parameters, and is typically an exercise in trade-off analysis. Things called **drivers**, that focus on particular system characteristics, are often used to help make allocation decisions and tradeoffs among the drivers. A dozen commonly used drivers are shown above. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Elaborating on some drivers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the functionality of the subsystems and components make them clear candidates for allocating the overall system functions. In situations where constant monitoring or measurements are required, for example, or where a high level of precision is required, are typically good candidates for allocating to hardware components\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality that requires interfacing to humans, software, or hardware are also considered during allocation. Hardware components typically dictate the interface specifics, either for software interfaces or human interfaces; human interfaces, particularly those that may need to be changed over time, are typically allocated to software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical constraints are another driver. In some projects there may be weight, space, or temperature constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost and schedule tradeoffs are obvious drivers that are usually applicable on most every project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Allocation Trade-off analysis decision techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different techniques. Most of them use a type of analysis called **multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).** MCDA helps us to make decisions about alternatives based on multiple criteria, in which some of the criteria may conflict with one another. MCDA is used in a number of engineering disciplines, including systems engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most MCDA techniques use some kind of **matrix**; called a **decision matrix**. A commonly used form of MCDA uses a decision matrix called the **Pugh Matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pugh Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic Pugh Matrix is shown below (though variations exist). A Pugh Matrix is **used to evaluate a number of alternatives compared to some baseline**. The baseline is typically an existing product or solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/06.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **rows** of the matrix list the criteria that the decision will be based on. The criteria will be chosen based upon what‘s important in a specifc problem. \n",
    "- **columns** of the matrix contain the alternatives that will be evaluated. There‘s also a column for the current solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‘s take an example of replacing an existing system with one of three alternate systems. Here, we‘re going to evaluate the three alternatives with respect to four decision criteria that we think are the most important. For this example: let‘s assume the criteria are **cost, schedule, performance, and reliability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our **baseline is the current system**, so we give it scores of **zero**. Then, we assess alternative 1 with respect to criteria 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is it better, the same, or worse than the baseline? \n",
    "- **better**, we give it a score of +1, \n",
    "- **same** we give it a score of 0, \n",
    "- **worse** we give it a score of -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, let‘s assume it‘s better, so we give it a +1. We then assess and score the remaining three criteria. Let‘s assume alternative one is the same for the second criteria, worse for the third criteria, and better for the fourth criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would then assess and score the second and third alternatives in a similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then; we add up the scores in each column to get an overall total. In this case, the best choice is alternative three, with a total score of plus 3. **It‘s also common to sum the positives, negatives, and neutrals**, so that more insight into the pros and cons of each alternative can be visualized. **This technique is useful because it helps us to make more objective and rational decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted Pugh Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variations on the scoring method. One variation is to **weight the criteria according to importance** and then **multiply the alternatives by the weights**:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/07.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example will use a set of weights that range from 1 to 5. let‘s assume that criteria one is given an importance rate of two, and that criteria two is considered twice as important...so we‘ll give it a weight of 4. Criteria three is somewhere between the first two criteria, so it gets a weight of 3. And, criteria four is the most important, so it gets a weight of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the +1, 0, and -1 scores for each of the alternatives are multiplied by the corresponding weights...so...the scores for the first criteria are multiplied by 2, the scores for the second criteria are multiplied by 4, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yet a third scoring variation**: is to expand the +1, 0, -1 scoring system to a two point system...where +2 would correspond to much better than the baseline, +1 would correspond to better than the baseline, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using it to allocate system functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now...how does one use this decision analysis technique to allocate system functionality to subsystems or components? There‘s a couple of ways this could be done, but the most straightforward way is to take each system function and construct a Pugh Matrix for it. The rows of the matrix correspond to the important drivers, and the columns correspond to the subsystem that the function is allocated to\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/08.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we‘ve discussed allocation of system level requirements to different system components...and we will assume that the appropriate system requirements have been allocated to software. So, going forward, we will leave the topic of systems engineering and focus on software engineering ...starting with **software requirements**\n",

    "What is requirements engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/10.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the system level requirements for a product have been allocated to the various system components, we are ready to discuss requirements engineering; more specifically the requirements that the software components of a system will be responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word engineering is used as a way of emphasizing the use of systematic and repeatable techniques that help to ensure the completeness, correctness, consistency, and continued relevance of software requirements for a software product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements engineering is not always called that in practice. It’s often called **requirements definition** or **requirements analysis**. But, limiting it to this leaves out an important keyword in both of the above definitions...and that keyword is **maintenance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements can and will change during the course of a project, and maintaining requirements means to keep up with and manage those changes. Recall that in our discussion of project management one of the umbrella processes was requirements management...and it is as part of the requirements management process that the maintenance typically takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also...using the term engineering to emphasize systematic and repeatable activities is very important, since, for many organizations, the activities performed during the requirements phase of a project tend to be ad hoc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the system-level requirements that are allocated to software are stated at a very high level...usually with a single sentence. So...they are not yet specified at a level of detail that would be sufficient to begin system design from...and...they may need to be decomposed into more specific requirements...or may spawn additional requirements that are necessary to correctly and completely specify the responsibilities of the software to be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...the initial activities of requirements engineering...which I‘ll refer to as the **requirements definition phase**...will need to be performed\n",

    "# Introduction to Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations have an incredibly difficult time doing requirements, and one of the main reasons for this is that they don't have a fully formed idea of just **what a requirement is**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is very problematic, because a person’s understanding of what a requirement is sets their expectations about things like what kinds of information needs to be gathered, what they think they are responsible for, what they think others are responsible for, and what they think the end result is supposed to be. The bottom line is that most projects start off with what I like to call unleveled expectations...and things just get worse from there as the project unfolds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**“leveling expectations”** is the first step to getting better requirements. But...how do you do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to ensure that stakeholder expectations are leveled is to start out with a common\n",
    "definition of what a requirement is and to communicate that definition to key project stakeholders. In this context, key project stakeholders include analysts, customers, end users, developers, testers and managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good definition of requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/11.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is good because it maps directly to the two major types of requirements associated with software development projects...namely, \n",
    "- **functional requirements** and \n",
    "- **non-functional requirements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional requirement is something the system must do...in other words, the behaviors the system must possess. These could be behaviors like calculations, saving information, or displaying information, for example. Functional requirements can be relatively simple...or...they can be quite complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/12.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take this example. I’ll provide some background information to add context. Let’s suppose our company sells widgets, and we are gathering requirements for an order entry system that will assist in processing sale transactions. Our sales department stakeholders need the system to calculate discounts on certain widget orders...so, calculate order discount is an example of a functional requirement...it’s something the system must do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic intent of the requirement is easy to understand...but the information required to document it is relatively complex because of the business rules associated with the calculation. This is a pretty well-written requirement, but its business rules are kind of complex...so there is a risk that the rules could be incomplete, incorrect, or misunderstood by those who must develop software to implement it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functional Requirement Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/13.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "A functional requirement can have 5 moving parts; \n",
    "- inputs, \n",
    "- outputs, \n",
    "- statement of intended functionality, \n",
    "- business rules, and \n",
    "- possibly constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We can map the prior example to the model. Starting with the \n",
    "- **Statement of intended functionality**: which is basically the name of the requirement: calculate order discount. \n",
    "- **Inputs**: A functional requirement can also have inputs. In the example there is one input variable - an order quantity. \n",
    "- **Outputs**: A functional requirement can have outputs, in the example the output was the calculated order discount amount. \n",
    "- **business rules**. Business rules specify how to take the inputs and convert them to the outputs. In our example, most of the written text was the business rules.\n",
    "- **Constraints** are criteria that have to be met in the performing of the function. There were no constraints in our example. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, constraints are things like a performance requirement that is mapped to a specific function...for example, a query must be performed within one second...or a constraint can be related to organization policy, regulatory policy, accuracy or precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a model like this one can help to ensure we gather complete and correct information for each functional requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-functional requirement is a condition that the system must comply with. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod041/14.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these examples don’t specify behaviors of the system, but rather conditions or constraints that the system must comply with. Non-functional requirements provide important information to the system designers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that these non-functional requirements are written as relatively simple shall statements. They don’t have all the moving parts that functional requirements do.\n",
