    "# 5E - User Interface Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "Input mechanisms give the user the capability of sending messages to the system to either control it or send information to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyboard**: One of the earliest and most common input mechanism is the keyboard. It resembles the old typewriter, down to the layout of the keys. The same skills that were needed for typing were now useful for keyboarding on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pointing Device (stylus, mouse, trackball):** Later on, as graphical user interfaces began to appear, some sort of device was needed to point to locations on the computer screen. Various pointing devices have been used but the most common devices in use today are the mouse and the stylus. The advantage of a stylus or finger on a touch screen is that there is practically no hand- eye coordination learning curve unlike with a mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Microphone:** Microphone input allows the user to use voice commands to control things or provide input. Voice commands are especially popular with small devices such as mobile phones, where using a keyboard is inconvenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Cameras**: Video cameras can be used as input devices to detect motion and gestures. Devices such as the Microsoft Kinect give us this capability for more than just videogames.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special Devices** And of course there are dozens of special devices that are used for input. Video game manufactures have popularized a lot of these devices. Also, there are devices for people with special needs to help make computers more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output mechanisms provide ways for the system to provide information to the user. They also allow system status to be communicated to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text or Graphics**: Of course, text or graphics on a computer screen is the most popular form of output mechanism.\n",
    "- **Auditory**: We have had auditory output for quite a while. But this has mostly been in the form of beeps and other sounds, mostly to indicate status. Think “You’ve got mail.” But increasingly we are seeing auditory output used for conveying information. Simulated voice can replace text on the screen. A good example is the turn by turn direction in a GPS navigation system. Again, this is particularly useful when the user is unable to see a screen, as when driving, or for people with special needs.\n",
    "- **Video**: Video and animation can be used to convey information or status. A really simple example of this is the animation that you see when the system is busy. The mouse pointer might become an animated gif, or the system might display a moving progress indicator.\n",
    "- **Haptic feedback** uses the sense of touch. A lot of mobile devices will provide a tactile buzz when the user touches icons or keys on the virtual keyboard. This feedback replaces the tactile feedback you would normally get when using a real keyboard or a mouse on a computer.\n",
    "- **Special devices**: Again, there are many special devices that have been invented for situations in which the more common devices such as screens or even audio output is not appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interaction Styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s talk about various styles of interacting with systems.\n",
    "* Command line\n",
    "* Menus\n",
    "* Form fill-in\n",
    "* Direct manipulation\n",
    "* Auditory commands\n",
    "* Gestures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line Interfaces (CLIs):\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest form of interaction style was the command line interface, or CLI. This is still in use today for some system level tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user must type commands on the command line.\n",
    "* User must recall the command. \n",
    "* User must recall the syntax.\n",
    "* User must recall the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands refer to the system objects and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive distance depends on how well the commands correspond to the user goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** of a command line interface are \n",
    "* Flexible and supports user initiative.\n",
    "* Appeals to power users.\n",
    "* Easy for user to create macros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **downsides** of command line interfaces include\n",
    "* Poor error handling\n",
    "* Substantial memorization and recall are required\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **guidelines** to follow when designing command line interfaces:\n",
    "* Command words should be consistent with user goals.\n",
    "* Consistent command and argument syntax\n",
    "* Symmetric commands.\n",
    "    * Symmetric: TAKE/RELEASE, FORWARD/BACKWARD.\n",
    "    * Non-symmetric: GRAB/UNHOOK, GO/BACK.\n",
    "* Consistent rule for command truncation.\n",
    "* Allow both full command and truncated command.\n",
    "* Consistent rule for keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menus:\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that recognition is better than recall, so very early on in the development of user interfaces, we saw the introduction of menu driven interaction. In the earliest days, the menus would be typed out on the teletype and the user would then enter a number or letter corresponding to the desired selection. This was much slower than command line interaction, particularly on a slow teletype.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** of menu interfaces include:\n",
    "* Shortens learning (recognition rather than recall).\n",
    "* Reduces keystrokes.\n",
    "* Structures decision-making (hierarchy).\n",
    "* Easy to support error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages** include:\n",
    "* Danger of many menus.\n",
    "* May slow frequent users.\n",
    "* Consumes screen space.\n",
    "* Requires rapid display rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **guidelines** for designing menu driven interfaces:\n",
    "* Give position in organization by graphic design, numbering, and titles.\n",
    "* Items should be brief and consistent.\n",
    "* Permit short-cuts for experienced users.\n",
    "* Use consistent layout and terminology.\n",
    "* Consider selection mechanisms and devices (mouse rather than keyboard).\n",
    "* Consider response time and display rate.\n",
    "* Consider screen size.\n",
    "* Offer help facilities.\n",
    "* Use familiar and consistent terminology.\n",
    "* Ensure that items are distinct from one another.\n",
    "* Use consistent and concise phrasing.\n",
    "* Bring the keyword to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fill in Forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill-in forms are a convenient way for the user to input a lot of information into the system. They are much better than question and answer dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** include:\n",
    "* Requires modest training – almost everyone knows how to fill in a form\n",
    "* In other words, there is a low cognitive distance between computer forms and paper forms.\n",
    "* Assistance is convenient. You can put defaults in some of the fields, you can show examples of information in case the user doesn’t know what to put into a particular field\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages** The main drawback is that the form consumes screen space. This can be a problem if the screen is not very large, such as on a mobile phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **guidelines** for designing fill-in forms include:\n",
    "* Comprehensible instructions:\n",
    "    * Use familiar terminology.\n",
    "    * Be brief.\n",
    "* Logical grouping and sequencing of fields:\n",
    "    * Alignment.\n",
    "    * Blocking.\n",
    "* Visually appealing layout of the form.\n",
    "* Familiar field labels.\n",
    "* Consistent terminology and abbreviations.\n",
    "* Visible space and boundaries for data entry fields.\n",
    "* Convenient cursor movement:\n",
    "* TAB key.\n",
    "* Arrow keys.\n",
    "* User error correction and editing.\n",
    "* Explanatory messages for fields.\n",
    "* Save contents of fields.\n",
    "* Automatically fill fields:\n",
    "* On new form with some fields duplicated.\n",
    "* On the same form when user returns to it.\n",
    "* Automatically fill in (some) fields with reasonable default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct Manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a direct manipulation interface, objects on the screen represent things in the application. Operations that you perform on objects on the screen correspond to operations on the things in the application. For example, moving an object from one place to another on the screen results in some information being modified inside the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** of direct manipulation interfaces include:\n",
    "* Easy to learn.\n",
    "* Easy to retain.\n",
    "* Errors can be avoided.\n",
    "* Encourages exploration.\n",
    "* High subjective satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **disadvantages** include:\n",
    "* Requires graphics display and pointing devices.\n",
    "* Some actions may be cumbersome.\n",
    "* May be difficult for those with impairments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some **guidelines** for developing direct- manipulation interfaces include:\n",
    "* Minimize movement. -- Fitts’ Law says that the time to move the pointing device and hit a target is directly proportional to the distance to the target and inversely proportional to the size of the target\n",
    "* Consider Affordances – UI mechanisms should look like they will do what they are designed to do. The user shouldn’t have to guess what a control will do. This means that we should minimize the cognitive distance between the user’s mental model and the designer’s model. This will have an impact on things like graphic design and labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the flexibility of the UI, the user may have many options of what to do next.\n",
    "* Enhances the user’s impression of being in control.\n",
    "* Allows for multitasking.\n",
    "* But may become confusing for novices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auditory:\n",
    "\n",
    "In situations where the user is unable to use his hands, control of the system may be accomplished through voice commands. This is a more recent development, mainly because of the hardware and software resources required for voice recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** are obvious. In addition to the hands-free aspect, there is emotional satisfaction of being able to talk to someone, enough so that we sometimes forget that we are talking to a machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**: Voice response capabilities are not perfect, yet. If we haven’t trained the system to recognize our voice, it sometimes interprets things wrong, leading to sometimes humorous or even embarrassing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gestures:\n",
    "\n",
    "As touch screens or touchpad interface devices are becoming more commonplace, we see the use of gesture inputs becoming more popular. It can be easier to use your fingers to resize a window than it is to use the mouse or keyboard to do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will probably see more use of body gestures as input mechanisms in the near future. Microsoft’s Kinect system offers some capability here. In fact, with the proper software, any video camera can be used to detect gestures.\n",

    "# 5F - Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "People will always make errors. They’re only human, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could classify errors by **their Severity**. The system will notify the user when an error has been made. There are three levels of error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usefull**: Useful error messages tell us when we have goofed and help us correct our mistakes. A good example is a spell checker in a word processing program. We’re usually grateful that we got the error message. If we hadn’t received the error we may not have spotted the typo ourselves, so these kinds of error messages can actually save us a lot of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Annoying**: Annoying messages are those that we receive when we already probably know we did something wrong. Did you ever push a button, and two microseconds after you pushed it you realized you pushed the wrong button? It’s too late to change your mind. We get the annoying error message anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dangerous**: We really need to be warned when we are about to do something dangerous. For example loss of data, loss of money, loss of secrets, injury to people, or in the worst case, loss of life. We need to be warned in the event that we try to do a dangerous action. Probably through a multiple levels of warning, depending on the severity of the risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mistakes**: Mistakes are where you have the wrong mental model. You think you are doing the right thing, but you are mistaken.\n",
    "    * Mixing up I.E., and E.G.,\n",
    "* **Slips:** Slips are where you have the right mental model; you just messed up in execution.\n",
    "    * E.g, typos: Teh quick bronw fox\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod051/03.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to handle errors is to prevent them from occurring in the first place.\n",
    "* For example, we could block inappropriate commands.\n",
    "    * Nothing happens when you attempt to execute the command, or, better yet, some sort of warning sounds. A beep is enough to tell the user that they can’t do what they just attempted to do.\n",
    "* A better way of preventing the error would be to disable the inappropriate commands.\n",
    "    * They still show up on the interface, but they are greyed out to indicate that they are inoperable.\n",
    "* Where you aren’t sure whether the command is inappropriate or not, we would leave it up to the user to decide. We would issue a confirmation prompt.\n",
    "    * Something like, “Do you really want to do this?”\n",
    "* Alternatively, we could provide an undo capability. The user would have to decide after the fact that he made an error and would be able to rectify the situation.\n",
    "    * We should also provide a re-do option, in case the user decides that yes, in fact, he did choose the right action.\n",
    "    * The confirmation prompt should be used if the operation requested cannot be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod051/04.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Message Guidelines \n",
    "* Be specific.\n",
    "    * Tell user what the problem was. \n",
    "* Provide constructive guidance.\n",
    "    * Give user advice about how to fix problem.\n",
    "* Be positive.\n",
    "    * Rather than condemning.\n",
    "    * Avoid words such as ILLEGAL, ERROR, INVALID, or BAD.\n",
    "    * Particularly for people who may not be comfortable with computers (yes, there still are some out there).\n",
    "    * These are emotionally charged words.\n",
    "    * You can get arrested for doing illegal things.\n",
    "* Use consistent visual format and placement of the error messages. Use consistent grammatical form, terminology, and abbreviations.\n",
    "* If the form requires scrolling over more than one screen, sometimes the user may not see the error message. Consider some kind of a modal popup dialog for the error message. A modal window requires a confirmation action, such as a mouse click, to dismiss it.\n",
    "* Consider the user’s experience and skill level. The kind of message you might display for a novice might be very annoying for an experienced user. Perhaps the user could be given the option to set the level of error messages.\n",
    "* Consider the culture of the region where the system will be deployed. There are many cultural differences between countries in Asia, Europe, the Americas and Africa. We need to be sensitive to cultural norms.\n",

    "# 5G - Prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "A prototype is a concrete, but partial implementation of a design.\n",
    "* Its basic purpose is to reduce risk in software development.\n",
    "    * The risk of us developing the wrong thing.\n",
    "    * Or the risk of the users not knowing what they want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prototypes expose misunderstandings.\n",
    "* There are user misunderstandings. This is where the users and customers:\n",
    "    * Don’t know what they are getting\n",
    "    * Or they don’t even know what they want.\n",
    "* Prototypes also prevent developer misunderstandings. If the developers don’t know what customer wants, they will develop what they think the customer wants (or just what they want to develop). Without a prototype, they are just guessing. (And they usually guess wrong.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Prototypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some benefits of prototypes:\n",
    "* Expose missing system capabilities.\n",
    "* Expose confusing services.\n",
    "* Early availability (through evolutionary prototyping).\n",
    "* Basis for specification of software requirements.\n",
    "* Support user training.\n",
    "* Support system testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low Fidelity (Lo-Fi) prototypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are low fidelity prototypes and high fidelity prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low fidelity** prototypes are sometimes called paper prototypes, because they are just sketches on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysts would talk through the scenarios using these prototypes. The prototypes would show what would be displayed on the screen at various points in the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can be used to show ways in which the user would interact with the system (for example, buttons or menus).\n",
    "Some of the **advantages of lo-fi prototypes** are that they are\n",
    "* Quick and easy to create or modify.\n",
    "* They use low cost materials.\n",
    "* Their roughness actually helps to control premature commitment and invites participation.\n",
    "* They allow for quick feedback, and permits more cycles of evaluation and revision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main **drawback of low fidelity prototypes** is that they are only sketches, and some people may have a hard time imagining the real interface when looking at them. They don’t have the sort of eyeball appeal that high fidelity prototypes might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of a low fidelity prototype is a storyboard. Storyboards have been used by all sorts of people who want to plan out sequences of events in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **storyboard** is a sequence of sketches illustrating key points in a scenario. They are usually sketched by hand. A narrative description of the action typically accompanies each frame. For movies and commercials, directions about camera angles and movement, lighting, and actor movement can also be annotated on the sketches.\n",
    "The main thing about a storyboard is that it depicts a single specific scenario, which is what makes it useful for planning out scenes in movies and TV commercials. But for user interfaces, there may be multiple scenarios for a particular interaction. Thus you would need multiple storyboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High Fidelity (hi-fi) Prototypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the other extreme you would have high fidelity prototypes. These are actually mock-ups of the actual user interface. The mock-up looks and works exactly like the final system, except it wouldn’t do anything. All of the buttons and menus work so you can navigate through the screens but all of the outputs are all simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mock-up should be written using a rapid prototyping language.\n",
    "\n",
    "One **benefit** of an executable prototype is that it is, well, executable. It is very useful for testing out ideas for interaction styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another **big benefit is** that changes to the interface would be easy and quick to make. If the mock-up is being reviewed with stakeholders, any suggested changes could be made in a matter of seconds. It wouldn’t take a great deal of time to perfect the interface, as long as everyone can agree on the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high fidelity prototype can be used to test out some of the psychological usability principles we discussed earlier, such as use of color, motion, sound, screen design, and so forth.\n",
    "High fidelity prototypes tend to impress clients\n",
    "\n",
    "and managers who are not deeply involved in the requirements process. They give the illusion that something is being accomplished.\n",
    "\n",
    "An executable prototype can give the documentation writers a head start in documenting the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **main down side of** these hi fidelity prototypes is that customers or end users could easily confuse the prototype with the finished system, since they look exactly the same. So you want to make sure that whomever you show the prototype to knows that it is only a mock-up and not the finished system.\n",
    "If you don’t have the proper tools, executable prototypes can be expensive to produce and may, in fact, slow down the process of usability design.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful technique for modeling user interaction is called **Screen flows and Layouts**. The layout of each of the screens is sketched out. Then we draw the flow diagram as a directed graph in which the nodes represent the screens, and the arrows represent the effect of navigation actions (e.g., button or menu selection). It shows all possible flows from screen to screen (sort of like a roadmap).\n",
    "\n",
    "The screen flow diagram can thus describe multiple scenarios. Each scenario would be only one path through the screen flow. There is no standard UML notation for screen flow diagrams, but you could possibly adopt the UML state transition diagram for this purpose. We will cover state transition diagrams in a later module of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Prototyping Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other prototyping techniques. \n",
    "* Mock-ups\n",
    "    * Where we would use fabricated devices with simulated controls. Astronauts trained in shuttle flight simulators before going out into space.\n",
    "* Wizard of Oz – “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.”\n",
    "    * We have a human behind the scenes simulate system actions and display appropriate output on the interface.\n",
    "* Video prototypes\n",
    "    * Which are recorded walkthroughs. These are great for selling. \n",
    "* Computer animations\n",
    "    * Are similar to video prototypes, but they are just software prototypes that run automatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ben Shneiderman teaches at the University of Maryland.\n",
    "\n",
    "He calls these the 8 golden rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common theme in Shneiderman’s 8 golden rules and Nielsen’s heuristics is the importance of consistency. Consistent look and feel. Consistent terminology, layout, mechanisms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes with graphical user interfaces, frequent users get frustrated with the number of mouse movements and clicks required for particular tasks. There ought to be a way to provide shortcuts for these folks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The users should have the feeling that they are in charge of the dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed error handling earlier. This is a big topic in Shneiderman’s book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last point about short-term memory has to do with something called the “magic number 7 plus or minus 2.” -- George Miller was a cognitive psychologist who wrote a landmark paper in 1956 reporting on his experiments with human subjects. Perhaps you remember this if you took a psychology class. He would present the subject with a number of items for a very short amount of time. Then he would ask them to recall the objects they’d seen. Most people could remember up to about 5 objects without many problems. Almost no one could recall all of the\n",
    "\n",
    "objects when he presented them with more than about 9 objects. Miller concluded that there was a short-term working memory in the brain that could hold about 7 plus or minus 2 pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this have to do with user interfaces? Well the user can’t focus on more than about 7 things at one time. Thus, we are advised to limit the number of things in the user interface to 7 plus or minus two: the number of menus, the number of items in a menu, the number of buttons, the number of windows, and so forth. Now if you look at a lot of software, there are certainly more than seven items in a menu, but if you look closely, they are grouped. There are no more than seven groups, and there are no more than seven items in any group. If the designers run out of these limits, they use cascading menus or dialog boxes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nielsen has a few items that didn’t appear on Shneiderman’s list. One is the match between the system and the real world. This is something that we stressed earlier in this module. Recognition rather than recall means that menus are better than command line interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last item about help and documentation is very important, as we all know. We all hear the advice that interfaces should be user friendly. I would suggest rewording this to say that interfaces should be user considerate. This goes back to the idea of the golden rule. Think about what you are doing to or for the user and be considerate.\n",
    "You can use the link shown to read the full descriptions of these heuristics. It is only a few pages long.\n",
