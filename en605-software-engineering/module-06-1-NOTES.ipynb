    "# 6A: Questions and Communication Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking effective questions are an important part of the software engineering process, especially during the requirements phase of a project. Asking questions is usually the primary technique used to elicit information.\n",
    "\n",
    "History has shown that business-side stakeholders (the source of requirements information), are generally not aware of the kinds of information and the level of detail that need to be gathered during the requirements phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Channels of Communication**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When people communicate, there are three channels that send information to someone. \n",
    "1) The first channel is the **verbal channel**: what you say…or what you write if the communication is in written form. \n",
    "2) The second channel is the **paraverbal channel**: it consists of how you say what you say in terms of word emphasis, tone of voice, and pacing. \n",
    "3) And the third channel is the **nonverbal channel**: or body language.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people communicate feelings, needs, likes, and dislikes, **93\\%** of the information that is sent is sent in the paraverbal and nonverbal channels. In fact, **55\\%** is sent in the nonverbal channel, **38\\%** in the paraverbal, and only **7\\%** in the verbal channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we use this? \n",
    "- One way is to be on the lookout for when the three channels are not in synch with each other. When the channels are out of synch, the **nonverbal channel** is the one that people **believe**. So you might have to ask additional questions to figure out what someone really means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A second way to use the three channels of communication has to do with **risk**: particularly risk associated with getting correct and complete requirements information. Often in the real world the primary form of getting requirements information from stakeholders is through **email**. We lose two channels of communication when written correspondence is used; the paraverbal and the nonverbal.\n",

    "# 6B: Asking Better Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s talk about the different types of questions one might ask during the course of requirements elicitation.  Remember six different types of questions: \n",
    "1) **open-ended** questions: \"How does. your process work?\" \n",
    "2) **closed-ended** questions: \"How many people are on your staff?\"\n",
    "3) **clarifying** questions: \"Do I understand correctly that ... \"?\n",
    "4) **probing** questions: \"Could you give me some examples of that?\" \n",
    "5) **leading** questions: \"You don't think we need changes do you?\" **(AVOID)**\n",
    "6) and **double-barreled** questions: \"What decisions do you make and how do you make them?\" **(AVOID)**\n",
    "\n",
    "When are each of these question types best used?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open-Ended:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-ended questions don’t seek a yes, no or finite response. You are asking someone to share potentially a lot of detailed information based on their knowledge, experience, or feelings. Professionals who study question methodology find that open-ended questions **are the most powerful type of question for learning about things**. And; they help you to get into people’s heads more easily. This is the type of question you could use to really draw someone out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Close-Ended\n",
    "\n",
    "The closed-ended question is useful when you need to get yes/no responses, very specific finite information, and to get agreement. **The downside to closed-ended questions is that they do not promote back-and-forth conversation**. So; this is a useful type of question, but its effectiveness is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Probing questions are useful when you need to follow-up and get more information about something, specific examples of something, or when someone has answered a prior question with a generic word like usually, mostly, sometimes, or often. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarifying Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarifying questions are very useful when you need to confirm your understanding of what someone has told you. It’s a way of feeding back what you have heard or understood, and it can also serve as a quality control check. If your understanding is not correct, or if a stakeholder didn’t communicate something correctly; though they thought they did; then this gives us an opportunity to correct things and move on. This type of question also lets someone know that you are listening to them; and that’s important, because one of the side effects is that people will tend to open up more if they know that you’re really listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leading Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leading questions should be avoided**. A leading question coaches a stakeholder as to how you want them to answer, and this can offend people. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Double-Barrel Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double-barreled questions should also be avoided**. A double-barreled question is one in which several questions…two, three, even four; are asked in a single sentence. The danger of this type of question is that you may not get the answer to all the questions, particularly if the answers are lengthy…so you may have to re-ask some of the questions again. Now, the problem with that is that many times the person who answered the questions will honestly think that they’ve answered them all; because they did hear them all; and there’s a good chance you will offend them because they can feel you weren’t listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "So; the four types of questions we want in our toolbox are the \n",
    "1) open-ended, \n",
    "2) probing, \n",
    "3) clarifying, and \n",
    "4) occasionally, the closed-ended question; especially if we are trying to learn about things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that if we primarily use email to elicit requirements information we are only left with one channel of communication; the written channel. Of these four types of questions, the only one that is really **practical to use in email communications is the closed-ended question**; but this doesn’t get us a whole lot of information if we are trying to learn about things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open-ended question is **difficult to use in emails because the response might be very lengthy**, and many people don’t like to write. So…many open ended questions in an email usually won’t be effective; even though open-ended questions are the type that are rich in information content. The probing and clarifying questions are also not effective in emails since they are used in response to a how a stakeholder answers a prior question.\n",
    "\n",
    "So really when getting requirements for something, it is best to do face-to-face or voice-to-voice at least - email is not great for this because you might miss a few things and it induces risk. \n",

    "# 6C: Some Tools and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Four tools commonly used in the requirements definition process: \n",
    "1) surveys, \n",
    "2) brainstorming, \n",
    "3) multi-voting, and \n",
    "4) cause-effect analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surveys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most have participated in a survey before. A questionnaire of some sort is used to pose questions to survey respondents. \n",
    "\n",
    "So; how might a survey be used during the requirements phase of a software engineering project? A survey can be a useful tool to elicit requirements from project stakeholders, under certain conditions, such as: \n",
    "* When there is a geographically diverse population of stakeholders, making face-to-face contact infeasible.\n",
    "* When there is a large number of stakeholders that input needs to be solicited from.\n",
    "* When it is important that most or all stakeholders be given the opportunity to provide input…perhaps for political reasons.\n",
    "* When there are time limitations for gathering requirements information.\n",
    "* Or…when it is desirable to do a quick exploratory study to assess something…like whether or not certain things are problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fairly common use of surveys is to poll users of existing software products to assess their satisfaction with existing functionality and perhaps to solicit suggestions for product enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things to consider when using a survey, is the design of the questionnaire. There’s an art and a science to knowing how to structure questions in just the right way; but it’s a relatively easy skill to learn. If the questions are not effective, we won’t get useful input; and if the questionnaire is too cumbersome, stakeholders won’t take the time to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brainstorming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very useful technique during the requirements phase is brainstorming. Brainstorming is a group process that can be used in many ways: \n",
    "* to generate ideas, \n",
    "* to generate possible solutions to problems, \n",
    "* to look at alternative ways to accomplish things. \n",
    "* It’s an excellent technique for getting people to think outside the box. \n",
    "* And, it’s also quick and very cheap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Used correctly, brainstorming also has a number of positive side effects: it can get a group of stakeholders working together and foster team-building, and it can help get “buy-in” from the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It most effective to use what's called structured brainstorming**. One of the advantages of keeping things structured is that you can retain control, and keep the process from deteriorating into a free-for-all that can be a waste of everyone’s time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/01.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to **clearly define the objective of the brainstorm**. For example, maybe the objective is to think of new product enhancements that would solve a particular problem that users are having.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to **set a time limit for people to think about their input**. Maybe 3 - 5 minutes. So; in that time frame you ask people to write down as many ideas as possible. A variation on this would be to break up the group into teams of two and have each team generate ideas. I might also extend the time limit to up to 10 minutes. People will typically lose focus after 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step is to **collect input from the group**. What you do is to go around the room and have each person contribute one idea, which you log on a white board or flip chart. If we’re doing this in a virtual setting, you'll open up a white board so that everyone can see the ideas. You make as many iterations as is necessary to get everyone’s input. Now; two very important rules that you use for this step is that only one person speak at a time; the person who is providing the input; and that no comments are allowed while someone is providing their input. These two rules help to keep things structured and avoids going off on tangents. It also keeps you in control.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth step involves **looking through the ideas**, maybe combining ideas that are the same but were stated using different words, maybe rewording things to improve clarity, or developing categories that the ideas belong to. Then, we may decide what the next actions are; perhaps we investigate each idea, or choose several ideas to discuss further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also may choose to complete a fifth step and **prioritize or rank the ideas**; or maybe come up with a short list of $N$ ideas that will be further explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing you can do is to tell people that they should assume there are no constraints for the problem at hand; even though there may be constraints. That will generate many more ideas and sometimes results in some very clever ideas; and it allows people to be more creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I might do is to take five minutes at the beginning and do a practice brainstorm. You pick a topic that is not work-related and may be humorous; like how can we raise a million dollars by the end of the day? This serves as an ice-breaker, it gets people familiar with the process, and it energizes the creative side of their brains. When people come to business meetings they usually focus on the left side of the brain; the logical side. Doing something fun helps them involve the right side, which is the creative side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Voting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-voting is a group technique that narrows a large list of items to a smaller list of high priority items or to a final selection. It can be used after a brainstorming session to narrow the list of items down to a smaller list, or when decisions must be made by a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/02.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s suppose we want to narrow down a list of items to the top ten most important. The first step is for each person in the group to **select the most important items on the list**. Each person can select 1/3 of the items as being most important. So; if there are 30 items on the list, each person can select the 10 most important. The criteria one uses to decide which are most important is up to each person. They don’t have to defend their choices or share the basis of their prioritization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to **tally the votes for each item on the list**. For in-person meetings, post-its or colored adhesive dots are often used. People just come up to a white board or flip chart and stick the post-its or dots next to the items they vote for. Whoever is facilitating the process then just counts the votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step consists of **eliminating the items with the fewest votes**. This is done according to the decision table. As an example, if there are 4 people in the group, any item with fewer than two votes is eliminated from further consideration. In our example, if we’ve reduced the list to the top ten, we’re done. Otherwise, we conduct another round of voting. The process repeats until we’ve reduced the list to the desirable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cause-Effect Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be used to analyze the possible causes of a problem, to analyze what can be done to mitigate a problem, or to identify and understand the factors that impact a problem, solution, or process.\n",
    " \n",
    "It’s a graphical technique that uses something called a cause-effect diagram. It’s easy to apply, and it also works nicely in group situations. It can even be used in conjunction with brainstorming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Identify root causes of unsatisfactory computer downtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/03.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the cause-effect diagram, we draw a box that contains a summary of the effect. In this example, the effect is the problem we want to find the root causes for computer downtime. Then, we draw a horizontal arrow that points to the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we draw four to six slanted arrows that point to the horizontal one. These represent what are called causal categories. In this example, the causal categories are users, software, hardware, and the computing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we try to identify specific causes that contribute to the effect, and add them under the appropriate causal categories. As an example, temperature or humidity might be contributing to downtime. They would be added to the environment causal category. Inadequate user training might be causing computers to crash…and so forth. Brainstorming might be used to help identify the specific causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are sometimes called **Fishbone Diagrams** or sometimes **Ishikawa diagrams** after the Japanese Engineer who came up with them. \n",

    "# 6D: Use Case Components\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary components to a use case: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **summary fields**: The summary fields contain information like the use case name, use case participants, use case goal, assumptions, and so forth.\n",
    "2) **main success scenario**: The main success scenario contains the typical interactions between users, other systems, and the system under development.\n",
    "3) one or more **alternate scenarios**: Alternate scenarios consist of interactions that describe alternate ways to achieve the goal of a use case, as well as interactions required to handle errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/05.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these are self-explanatory, but let's look a few of them in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/06.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "An actor is someone or some thing that interacts with the system we are gathering requirements for. Actors can be users, other systems, or time. Time is a kind of unusual actor, and one that is sometimes misunderstood. As an example, there may be a requirement that a report be generated at midnight each day that summarizes all the sale transactions for that day. Time would be an actor in such a use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actors that participate in a use case are typcially documented in an actors field; and an actor glossary is created that provides brief descriptions of each actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor names should be meaningful in the business domain. Actor names often correspond to roles that get played by users of the system or job positions in an organization. Actor names shouldn‘t be too abstract. The reader of a use case should be able to recognize most actors based upon the role they play in the business domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important rules when it comes to actors: actors must be external to the system we are gathering requirements for, and, a use case must have at least one actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/07.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every use case must have a name; and the name should give us some idea about the goal of the use case; as you\n",
    "can see from these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic forms that use case names take on: \n",
    "1) Actor-action-subject; as in Cashier Processes Sale, and \n",
    "2) action-subject; as in process refund. In practice, we pick one form and use it consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a simple use case diagram called a context diagram. Actors are shown as stick figures, use cases are shown as ovals, and the lines connecting the actors to the use cases indicate which actors participate in which use cases. The lines are technically called links. The rectangle is used to denote the scope of the system we are gathering requirements for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Triggers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/08.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common use case information field is a trigger field. A trigger is an event that causes a use case to start. It may be a business event; for example, in the process sale use case a customer may arrive at a point of sale station with merchandise to purchase; which causes a cashier to start a new sale transaction, or it may be an action that an actor takes that causes a new use case to start. As an example, in a bank atm system, a customer is presented with a menu of transaction options. Selecting the withdraw funds option causes the withdraw funds use case to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preconditions\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/09.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Very commonly used and Many people don't fully understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-condition describes the state of the system that is required before a use case can attempt to start. There are a few important things to remember about pre-conditions: \n",
    "1) anything a use case must check for is not a pre-condition. \n",
    "2) use cases can be pre-conditions for other use cases, and third, it is not mandatory that a use case have pre-conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-conditions help give context to the reader of a use case, and also to developers who need to implement the software components required to support a use case. Sometimes, pre-conditions are trivial; like the system must be operational. In those cases, it’s okay to say there are no pre-conditions; because it’s quite obvious. When one use case branches to another use case, the use case branched from becomes a pre-condition for the use case branched to.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/10.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s extremely important to understand that use cases don’t check whether pre-conditions are true; so; anything a use case must check for can’t be one of its pre-conditions. Take a look at this example for a bank ATM system. The use case name is Customer Uses ATM, and it describes the interactions involved in an ATM session. A customer logs in by entering an ATM card and a valid PIN, the system then presents the customer with a menu of transaction types, the customer chooses a transaction type, and the interactions continue until the customer ends the ATM session. The first five steps of the use case are shown here. Note that the system must validate the card and the PIN…so it is incorrect to specify these as pre- conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/11.png\" width=450>\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-conditions are another very common field. A post-\n",
    "condition describes the state of the system after a use\n",
    "case has taken place successfully. Successfully is a key\n",
    "word here. Here’s an example of post-conditions for the\n",
    "process sale use case I have been using.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, I often get questions about post-conditions\n",
    "from my clients. They think they may be doing\n",
    "something wrong, because they’re just kind of\n",
    "regurgitating information that’s already in the use case.\n",
    "For example, if we went back and read the nine or ten\n",
    "steps in the process sale use case we’d see specific steps\n",
    "for exactly what’s in these post-conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-conditions just summarize what will have been\n",
    "accomplished if everything works correctly. When my\n",
    "clients sometimes tell me that they aren’t adding any\n",
    "value for them, I often tell them to drop the post-\n",
    "conditions since they don’t add value. Some project\n",
    "stakeholders, however, like testers, may find the post-\n",
    "conditions to be valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to remember about post-conditions is\n",
    "that a use case may not have any. Only when the state of\n",
    "a system is changed will there be post-conditions. As an\n",
    "example, if we had a use case that described a user\n",
    "doing a query of a database, there may not be any post-\n",
    "conditions for such a use case since the system state is\n",
    "not changed. If the query was logged, however, there\n",
    "would be a post-condition.\n",

    "# 6E: Main Success and Alternate Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "Now looking at the other two aspects of use case components:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/04.png\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the main success scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/12.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we discussed the basic information fields associated with a use case. The information fields dont‘ really contain any direct information about requirements. The requirements information is described in the use case scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main success scenario is the first use case scenario that we write. It consists of a series of steps called action steps...and it also has a very important rule associated with it...everything works perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‘s an example of a main success scenario for a bank ATM system. If you read through the nine steps you can see that they are written under the assumption that everything works perfectly. Steps 2 and 5 are validation steps...and we assume that the validations are successful. We use a different type of scenario to deal with situations in which the validations are not successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another basic guideline for writing a main success scenario is that it shouldn‘t have more than about 10-12 steps. The reason for this is that we want the reader of a main success scenario to be able to capture a mental picture of the basic story being told by this scenario...and if it has too many steps this will be hard to accomplish...there will be too much to remember. Take a look at each of the action steps. They take on certain characteristics. On the left hand column are the\n",
    "\n",
    "actor interactions. The customer is interacting with the system. On the right hand side, the system is performing various functions...prompting, validating, and so forth. This is the only type of step we want to have on the right-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "So...these illustrate two basic rules for action steps. An action step can be an actor interaction or a system function. A third type of action step is a branch to another use case...and that‘s illustrated in step 7. Depending upon the selection a customer makes the customer uses ATM story will branch to one of four other use cases...deposit funds, withdraw funds, and so forth. I‘m underscoring the names of the use cases...it‘s just a notation I like to use because it‘s concise and the underscore connotes a hyperlink...which is exactly what branching to another use case is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that below step 7 there is a statement written in italics. This is an annotation called a repetition clause. I wrote it in italics because I wanted it to stand out visually. Note also that this annotation is not numbered. Only the action steps should get numbered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"ss/mod061/13.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few guidelines for writing action steps. I’ll elaborate on the last\n",
    "one…referencing data elements and business rules…and leave the others\n",
    "for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "When business rules or data elements are associated\n",
    "with an action step, it‘s best to reference them in the\n",
    "action step rather than hard-coding them into the action\n",
    "step. This makes the use case more concise and easier to\n",
    "read, and improves maintainability in case the data\n",
